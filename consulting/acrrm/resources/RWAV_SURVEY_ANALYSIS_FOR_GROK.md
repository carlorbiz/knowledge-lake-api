## Key Stakeholder Quotes

> "We're all working on the same problems but in silos. RWAV could be the connective tissue that brings us together and stops the duplication that wastes everyone's time and energy." – Regional Health Service Manager

> "If someone could just bring all the key players together regularly and help us see what everyone else is doing, half our problems would be solved. We're not lacking ideas or energy – we're lacking coordination." – GP Supervisor

> "Solutions developed in Melbourne without community input rarely work here. We know what we need – we just need someone to listen and help us make it happen." – Rural Community Health Committee Member

> "I am so inspired by the truly dedicated health professionals that are working to the bone to hold this community afloat. The skills amongst rural health workers are so strong, but they can't effectively support the entire community without more support." – Medical Student Respondent

## Strategic Mandate

The survey provides:
- **Evidence**: 91% coordination crisis + 66% transformative solution potential
- **Permission**: 74% trust in RWAV vs 37% in government
- **Validation**: 92% support for partnerships
- **Urgency**: Stakeholders demanding change, not requesting incremental improvement

## Conclusion Statement

"Rural health stakeholders are not asking for more programs, additional recruitment services, or incremental improvements. They are explicitly calling for systems coordination, community-led planning, and collaborative approaches. Stakeholders trust RWAV more than government departments to lead this coordination – creating unique positioning advantage and strategic permission for transformation."
