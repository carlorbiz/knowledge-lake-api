Ackr’m Practice Support Handbook
For Practice Managers and Training Posts

Document Purpose and Scope
This handbook is the definitive source of truth for Ackr’m accredited training posts and practice managers supporting Rural Generalist registrar training. It consolidates all procedural, administrative, educational, and compliance requirements for training posts across primary care, hospital, Aboriginal Medical Service (A.M.S.), and Advanced Specialised Training (A.S.T.) settings.

Target Audience: Practice Managers, Training Post Administrators, Principal Supervisors, Additional Supervisors, Training Program Advisors (T.P.A.’s), and regional support teams working in rural and remote healthcare settings across Australia.


1. Welcome and Introduction
About Ackr’m
Welcome to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (Ackr’m), the home of the Rural Generalist.

The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine is a professional medical college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define standards and deliver specialist training in the discipline of general practice. Fellows of Ackr’m (Fackr’m) receive specialist registration as a General Practitioner with the Medical Board of Australia and can practise in any location throughout Australia. Ackr’m's curriculum and training programme also prepare doctors to become Rural Generalist medical practitioners—specialists uniquely equipped to serve rural, remote, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.
The Critical Role of Training Posts
Being an Ackr’m training post plays a vital role in registrar success and training outcomes. The quality of experiences registrars receive during their placements has a profound and lasting impact—not only on their clinical competence and confidence but also on their overall inclination to pursue a Rural Generalist career pathway and return to rural and remote practice.

Ackr’m envisages a holistic, community-embedded approach to registrar training. We promote communities of practice within each training post, recognising that excellent training environments emerge when practice teams work collaboratively to support registrar development.
Purpose of This Handbook
This handbook is designed to provide training posts—and especially Practice Managers—with comprehensive information, procedural guidance, and ready access to resources for creating and sustaining the desired environment for Rural Generalist training.

Key Objectives:

- Provide clear, actionable guidance for Practice Managers on administrative systems, timelines, and compliance requirements
- Map all procedural touchpoints between training posts, registrars, T.P.A.’s, and Ackr’m systems (R.G. Hub, Aptify, Prodah or H-pos)
- Consolidate resource links, templates, and proformas to support day-to-day training post operations
- Clarify roles, responsibilities, and reporting obligations across the registrar training lifecycle
- Serve as the single source of truth for training posts and supervisors

Ackr’m maintains a collegial working relationship with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) to ensure training posts and supervisors are not burdened by unnecessary duplication of accreditation or administrative processes. Where possible, we work collaboratively on bi-college placement processes and shared standards to support dual-fellowship registrars and training posts accredited by both colleges.


2. Rural Generalist Medical Practitioner
Definition and Scope
A Rural Generalist medical practitioner is a General Practitioner who has developed specific expertise in providing comprehensive medical care for rural, remote, and isolated communities.

Rural Generalist practitioners:

- Understand and respond to the diverse and often complex healthcare needs of rural communities
- Apply a population health approach, recognising the social, cultural, and environmental determinants of health in rural settings
- Provide safe, high-quality primary, secondary, and emergency care across the lifespan and across a broad scope of practice
- Deliver culturally engaged healthcare for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, respecting and responding to cultural knowledge, protocols, and community leadership
- Provide specialised medical care in at least one additional discipline (such as emergency medicine, anaesthetics, obstetrics, mental health, paediatrics, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, or other Advanced Specialised Training disciplines recognised by Ackr’m)

Rural Generalists are the backbone of healthcare delivery in regional, rural, and remote Australia. Their extended scope, clinical breadth, and community-embedded practice make them uniquely capable of delivering accessible, continuous, high-quality care in settings where specialist and tertiary services are distant or unavailable.

Training posts play a pivotal role in shaping these doctors and instilling the values, skills, and resilience required for Rural Generalist practice.


3. Standards for Supervisors and Training Posts
Application and Scope
The Standards for Supervisors and Training Posts apply to all supervisors and training posts training registrars on the Ackr’m Fellowship Training Program. These standards apply to:

- Core Generalist Training (C.G.T.) in primary care, hospital, and emergency settings
- Advanced Specialised Training (A.S.T.) in all Ackr’m-recognised disciplines
Outcome-Based Standards
The Standards are outcome-based and do not prescribe rigid inputs such as specific hours, percentages, or fixed teaching formats. Instead, they describe the educational environment, supervision quality, and learning outcomes expected of accredited posts.

The description of evidence within the Standards provides guidance on Ackr’m's expectations for training posts participating in the Ackr’m Fellowship Training Program. These expectations are grounded in the competencies, knowledge, skills, and attributes described in the Rural Generalist Curriculum.
Key Principles
Training posts and supervisors are expected to:

- Provide a safe, respectful, and supportive learning environment that fosters registrar confidence, clinical skill development, and professional identity formation
- Ensure patient safety is maintained at all times through appropriate supervision, oversight, and graduated responsibility
- Deliver structured orientation, teaching, and feedback tailored to the registrar's stage of training and learning needs
- Support registrar wellbeing and resilience through pastoral care, workload management, and responsive problem-solving
- Maintain accreditation compliance and engage with Ackr’m's quality assurance and continuous improvement processes

Accreditation is granted to individual supervisors and individual training posts. Accreditation processes for supervisors and posts may occur concurrently or separately, depending on the circumstances of the application.


4. Information Management Systems

Part 2: Accreditation and Site Preparation

7. Becoming an Accredited Training Post
7.1 Background and Requirements
All Ackr’m registrar training must take place in accredited training posts. Accreditation is based on the Standards for Supervisors and Training Posts and ensures that training environments meet quality, safety, and educational benchmarks.

Key Accreditation Principles:

- Registrars must have a nominated accredited supervisor throughout training (either a Principal Supervisor or, in some circumstances, an Additional Supervisor providing coverage)
- Training placements must provide the opportunity to gain the required scope, type, and volume of clinical experience at an appropriate level of responsibility
- Individual accreditation: Supervisors and training posts are accredited individually. The accreditation process for supervisors and posts may occur concurrently or separately.

Types of Training Posts Accredited by Ackr’m:

- Primary care: General practices in rural, remote, and regional areas
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander medical services (A.M.S.): Community-controlled health services and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (Atchos)
- Hospitals: Rural and remote hospitals providing primary care clinics, emergency department experience, and inpatient care
- Emergency departments and retrieval services with integrated primary care clinics

Recognition of Other Accreditations:

- Ackr’m recognises training posts accredited by state and territory Postgraduate Medical Councils (P.M.C.'s) for doctors undertaking junior doctor terms during Core Generalist Training (C.G.T.)
- Ackr’m also recognises training posts accredited by other specialist colleges as suitable for short-term placements (up to three months) to fulfil mandatory training requirements
- For long-term placements in disciplines recognised by Ackr’m for Advanced Specialised Training (A.S.T.), posts accredited by other specialist colleges may be suitable, but Ackr’m accreditation is required for placements longer than three months
7.2 Benefits of Becoming an Accredited Training Post
Practices that invest in accreditation and commit to training registrars experience significant benefits:

Professional and Educational Benefits:

- Enhance your training post's reputation as a leader in medical education and rural health workforce development
- Strengthen collaborative relationships with other organisations involved in teaching registrars, medical students, and junior doctors
- Enhance the teaching skills of supervisors, fostering a culture of continuous professional development and reflective practice
- Contribute to and shape future generations of Rural Generalist GP’s who will serve rural and remote communities

Practice Benefits:

- Inject fresh perspectives and energy into your training post, which may stimulate process improvements, quality initiatives, and innovation
- Build relationships with doctors who may return to your practice or region as Fellows, supporting succession planning and workforce retention
- Access to registrar services to support practice capacity and patient access

- Strengthen community health infrastructure through registrar involvement in local health networks and outreach services
7.3 Readiness to Train: Key Considerations
Before committing to accreditation and registrar training, practices should carefully assess their readiness across multiple domains.

Clinical Experience and Service Quality:

- Will your practice be able to provide relevant clinical experience across the breadth and depth required by the Rural Generalist Curriculum?
- Is your practice able to provide a safe and high-quality health service with appropriate clinical governance, risk management, and quality improvement systems?

Resources and Infrastructure:

- Does the practice have appropriate physical space (consulting rooms, shared clinical areas, teaching spaces) to accommodate a registrar?
- Are practice systems (IT, clinical software, appointment scheduling, clinical documentation, billing) robust and user-friendly for a learner?
- Is administrative support available to assist with registrar onboarding, rostering, and training-related documentation?

Supervision Capacity:

- Who is suitable, willing, and available to provide the level of supervision required for registrars at different stages of training?
- Does the practice have sufficient supervisor capacity to meet supervision ratios (generally no more than two first-term [G.P.T. 1] registrars per Principal Supervisor at any one time)?
- Is there an Additional Supervisor or supervisory team available to provide coverage when the Principal Supervisor is on leave or unavailable?

Educational Commitment:

- Can the practice quarantine mandated formal teaching time (3 hours per week for first-term registrars, 1.5 hours per week for second-term registrars)?
- Is the practice prepared to support registrar educational leave for Ackr’m workshops, courses, and mandatory training activities?
- Is there a culture of learning and teaching within the practice that will support registrar development?

Commitment and Culture:

- Is the practice committed to long-term engagement with training (recognising that accreditation may not guarantee a registrar every semester)?
- Does the practice have a community of practice approach, with all staff (GP’s, nurses, allied health, administrative staff) engaged in supporting registrar learning?
7.4 Attributes of a Good Training Post

8. Accreditation Site Visits
8.1 Purpose and Scope
The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine's accreditation standards and guidelines stipulate that a site visit must take place as part of the compliance evaluation process. The site visit is the final component of the evaluation of the accreditation submission and provides an opportunity for:

- Ackr’m accreditation representatives to clarify minor ambiguities in the application and assess the training environment
- Training post representatives (Practice Managers, supervisors, practice owners) to seek information about Ackr’m and registrar training processes, ask questions, and discuss practice-specific arrangements
8.2 Timing of Site Visits
The timing and format of the site visit depend on whether the application is for a new accreditation or a re-accreditation.
New Accreditation
- The site visit is the final stage of the new accreditation evaluation process
- The visit must take place prior to granting final approval of the training post and supervisors
- The visit allows Ackr’m to confirm compliance with Standards and provides the training post with an opportunity to demonstrate readiness to train
Re-Accreditation
- Training posts that have previously undergone initial accreditation and approval processes will initially be granted a 12-month "approved provisional" accreditation status following a satisfactory desktop audit of the re-accreditation submission
- During the 12-month provisional period, a virtual site visit will be conducted
- The visit provides an opportunity for Ackr’m to discuss the nuances of registrar training, explore educational opportunities available at the post, and answer any queries training post representatives have about Ackr’m processes, policies, or changes since the last accreditation cycle
8.3 Preparation for the Site Visit
The site visit is designed as a two-way discussion about delivery of registrar training and the placement environment. Extensive preparation is not required, but Practice Managers should have the following information available:

Patient Demographics:

- Overview of patient population demographics, particularly:
- Percentage of patients identifying as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander
- Age distribution (paediatric, adult, aged care proportions)
- Common presenting conditions and clinical areas of practice focus

Optional:

- Training posts may offer a virtual tour of the facility if they wish, but this is not expected or required

Participants:

- At a minimum, the Principal Supervisor must attend
- Practice Managers, Additional Supervisors, practice owners, and other relevant staff are welcome and encouraged to participate
- Ackr’m representatives typically include:
- Accreditation representative
- Training Program Advisor (T.P.A.)
- Sometimes the Regional Director of Training (R.D.O.T.) and/or Training Network Coordinator may attend to better understand the training environment
8.4 The Site Visit Process

- Community integration and social supports

3. Education Processes and Opportunities:

- In-practice teaching arrangements (formal and informal)
- Supervision models and capacity
- Access to diverse clinical experiences (procedural skills, emergency care, chronic disease management, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, etc.)
- Opportunities for hospital work, V.M.O. arrangements, or after-hours experience (if applicable)

4. Patient Safety:

- Clinical governance structures and processes
- Supervision protocols and escalation pathways
- Risk management and critical incident reporting systems
- Quality improvement activities
8.5 After the Site Visit
If Compliance is Confirmed:

- If the site visit reinforces compliance with Ackr’m's accreditation standards, the training post and supervisor accreditation end dates are extended to the maximum of three years
- Accreditation status is updated from "approved provisional" to "approved"
- New training posts are entered for the full three-year cycle with an "approved" status

If Compliance Gaps are Identified:

- Site visits that identify compliance gaps are assessed on a case-by-case basis
- Measures may include:
- Involvement of the regional team to work with training post representatives to address knowledge gaps
- Provision of additional resources, guidance, or targeted professional development
- Extension or adoption of "approved provisional" status whilst training posts mitigate identified areas of concern
- In rare cases, conditional accreditation or deferral of accreditation pending remediation

Follow-Up:

- T.P.A.’s will follow up with training posts after site visits to provide written confirmation of accreditation status and any actions required
- Training posts will receive updated accreditation certificates reflecting new accreditation end dates

Part 3: Placement Process and Registrar Onboarding

11. Registrar Placement Process
11.1 Open-Market Placement System
It is important to understand that being an accredited training post does not guarantee you will receive an Ackr’m registrar. Ackr’m's registrar placement process is based on an open-market style system with a bi-college approach in collaboration with RACGP.

Key Features:

- Every six months, accredited training posts can choose to be included in the training placements process
- Training Post profiles are accessible to registrars to promote facilities and communities
- Registrars can apply for advertised vacancies or advise the College of agreed arrangements with training posts
- In some regions, there may be more training vacancies than registrars available, meaning some practices may not attract a registrar
- Ackr’m works with RACGP to manage allocation of training placements and ensure equitable distribution across regions and training pathways

Bi-College Collaboration:

Ackr’m and RACGP collaborate to:

- Align placement timing to minimise disruption for dual-fellowship registrars and training posts accredited by both colleges
- Assess training practice capacities each term, which limit the number of registrars per supervisor and per post (capacities may change from term to term based on practice circumstances and supervisor availability)
- Communicate and collaborate to ensure equity in access to training posts and registrars
11.2 Registrar Placement Workflow
The following workflow outlines the typical steps from registrar allocation to placement confirmation and funding access.
Step 1: Registrar Allocation List Generated
- The Program Coordinator/Training Post Operations Coordinator (P.C. forward slash T.P.O.C.) generates the registrar allocation list for the upcoming semester
- The list is sent to Training Program Advisors (T.P.A.’s) with accreditation information for each training post
Step 2: Regional Team Meets with Registrar
- The regional team (Medical Educator, R.D.O.T., T.P.A.) meets with the registrar to discuss placement preferences, learning needs, and suitability of proposed placements
Step 3: Placement Approval by M.E./R.D.O.T.
- The Medical Educator (M.E.) and Regional Director of Training (R.D.O.T.) review and approve proposed placements to ensure they align with registrar progression requirements and curriculum needs
- If a registrar proposes a self-arranged placement, the M.E. must approve the placement before it proceeds
Step 4: T.P.A. Sends Placement Approvals and Documentation
- The T.P.A. sends placement approval notification and required documentation to both the registrar and the training post
- Documentation includes:
- Placement Confirmation Form (to be completed by registrar, supervisor, and Practice Manager)
- Training Post Agreement (T.P.A.) template
- Medicare Provider Number (M.P.N.) application guidance
- Employment contract checklist and NTCER compliance guidance
Step 5: Training Post Status Determines Next Steps
If Training Post is Not Yet Accredited:

- T.P.A. provides guidance on accreditation portal access and application process
- Practice Manager completes accreditation application in R.G. Hub
- Accreditation Coordinator reviews application and schedules site visit
- Once accreditation is granted, proceed to Step 6

If Training Post Requires Re-Accreditation:

- T.P.A. provides guidance on re-accreditation paperwork
- Practice Manager completes re-accreditation application in R.G. Hub
- Accreditation Coordinator processes re-accreditation (desktop audit and site visit as required)
- Once re-accreditation is confirmed, proceed to Step 6

If Training Post is Already Accredited:

- Proceed directly to Step 6
Step 6: Placement Documentation Returned to T.P.A.
- Registrar, supervisor, and Practice Manager complete and sign Placement Confirmation Form
- Practice Manager completes Medicare Provider Number application (on behalf of registrar, via registrar's My College Dashboard)
- All placement documentation is returned to T.P.A.
Step 7: T.P.A. Emails Documentation to Accreditation Coordinator
- T.P.A. sends the following to Accreditation Coordinator (AC):
- Medicare application (forwarded to Medicare)
- Placement Confirmation Form
- Re-accreditation paperwork (if applicable)
Step 8: Medicare Application Submitted
- T.P.A. sends Medicare application to Medicare on behalf of registrar
- Medicare processes application (typically 4-6 weeks; registrars should apply at least 8 weeks before placement commencement)
Step 9: Accreditation Coordinator Processes Accreditation/Re-Accreditation
- Accreditation Coordinator processes any outstanding accreditation or re-accreditation requirements for the training post (if applicable)
Step 10: Accreditation Coordinator Enters Rotation and Triggers First Payment
- Accreditation Coordinator enters the registrar rotation details into R.G. Hub
- Entry of rotation triggers the first funding payment cycle (N.C.P. for A.G.P.T. registrars, R.G.T.S. payment for R.G.T.S. registrars)
11.3 Training Post Capacity and Supervisor Ratios
Recommended Capacity Limits:

- No more than two first-term (G.P.T. 1) registrars per Principal Supervisor at any one time
- Supervisor capacity may be adjusted based on practice size, Additional Supervisor availability, and complexity of registrar needs
- Ackr’m and RACGP assess training practice capacities each term and may adjust capacity limits based on practice circumstances

Practice Manager Responsibility:

- Inform your T.P.A. if supervisor availability or practice circumstances change (e.g., supervisor leave, practice closures, reduced clinical sessions)
- Changes in capacity may affect future placement allocations
11.4 V.M.O. Arrangements and Rostering
Registrars are encouraged to participate in the full spectrum of Rural Generalist practice whilst in training, including Visiting Medical Officer (V.M.O.) work in local hospitals, after-hours care, and emergency department shifts.

Rostering Requirements:

- Rostering of registrars for both ordinary and on-call hours must be equitable (in comparison to other doctors in the practice)
- Where possible, rosters should be developed in consultation with the registrar before the term commences
- Registrars should not be rostered for excessive on-call or after-hours work that compromises their educational activities or wellbeing

V.M.O. Remuneration:

- Discuss with the registrar how they will be paid for V.M.O. work prior to them starting the term
- V.M.O. remuneration arrangements vary by location, health service, and employment model
- Ensure V.M.O. payment arrangements are clearly documented in the employment contract
11.5 Screening and Interview Process
Ackr’m recommends training posts adopt a robust screening and interview process to ensure mutual fit between registrar and training post.

Information Registrars Should Provide:

- Current curriculum vitae (C.V.) detailing medical qualifications, training history, and clinical experience
- AHPRA registration details (ensure registrar has full and general registration as a medical practitioner)
- Evidence of appropriate Professional Indemnity Insurance (P.I.I.)
- References from previous supervisors or employers

Recommended Interview Discussion Points:

1. Training Stage and Pathway:

- What is the registrar's current term level (G.P.T. 1, G.P.T. 2, etc.) and where are they in their training journey?
- Which training pathway is the registrar enrolled in (A.G.P.T., R.G.T.S., IP, R.V.T.S.)?

2. Full-Time or Part-Time Training:

- Will the registrar be training full-time or part-time?
- If part-time, what are the proposed working arrangements (days per week, hours per week)?

3. Semester and Duration:

- Which semester will the placement occur (Semester 1 or Semester 2)?
- What is the anticipated duration of the placement (6 months, 12 months, longer)?

4. Hospital Admitting Rights and V.M.O. Work:

- Are there admitting rights to the local public hospital?
- Does the registrar have interest in and capacity for V.M.O. work, on-call, or emergency department shifts?

5. Educational and Special Interests:

- What are the registrar's areas of educational interest and clinical focus (e.g., obstetrics, dermatology, emergency medicine, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, mental health)?
- How can the training post support these interests?

6. NTCER Items and Employment Conditions:

- Working hours arrangement (ordinary hours, on-call, after-hours)
- Remuneration (base salary, V.M.O. payments, superannuation)
- Leave entitlements (annual leave, personal/carer's leave, parental leave, study leave)
- Mandatory educational release time (see Section 20 for detailed requirements)

7. Accommodation and Support (Rural and Remote Placements):

- For more rural and remote placements, registrars should discuss with the training post whether there is any accommodation support, relocation assistance, or additional community integration support available

Conflict of Interest Considerations:

The College must be notified of potential conflicts of interest during the placement process, such as if a registrar has any type of close personal relationship with a staff member at the practice.

- Registrars are usually not placed at a practice if there is a significant pre-existing relationship with the supervisor, practice owner, or Practice Manager
- It is not preferred to place a registrar at a practice if they have a significant pre-existing relationship with another staff member (e.g., practice nurse, administrative staff, other GP)
- Refer to the Ackr’m Conflict of Interest Policy Statement


12. Preparing for the Registrar
12.1 Pre-Placement Meeting
Ackr’m advises all registrars to arrange a pre-placement meeting with their supervisor and Practice Manager prior to starting their term.

14. Medicare Provider Number Process
14.1 Importance of Medicare Provider Number (M.P.N.)
Patients are not eligible to claim their Medicare rebate if the registrar does not have an active Medicare Provider Number.

It is the registrar's responsibility to ensure they have an active M.P.N. before starting the placement. However, Practice Managers play a critical support role in facilitating the M.P.N. application process and confirming M.P.N. activation with Medicare before the registrar commences clinical work.
14.2 M.P.N. Application Process
Step 1: Registrar Initiates Application via My College Dashboard
- Registrars apply for their M.P.N. using the application portal on their My College Dashboard
- The application requires details from:
- The registrar (personal details, AHPRA registration, qualifications)
- The training post (practice name, address, practice manager contact details, supervisor details)
- The placement (start date, duration, training pathway)
Step 2: Practice Manager Assists with Training Post Details
- Practice Managers should assist registrars with completing the training post sections of the M.P.N. application
- Ensure all practice details (name, address, A.B.N., supervisor name and AHPRA registration number) are accurate
Step 3: Ackr’m Endorses the Application
- Once the registrar submits the application via My College, it is automatically forwarded to Ackr’m for endorsement
- The College must endorse the M.P.N. application before Medicare will process it
- Ackr’m verifies that:
- The registrar is enrolled in an Ackr’m training pathway
- The training post is accredited
- The placement has been approved by the Medical Educator and Regional Director of Training
Step 4: Ackr’m Forwards Application to Medicare
- Once endorsed, Ackr’m forwards the M.P.N. application to Medicare (Services Australia)
- Medicare processes the application (typically 4-6 weeks)
Step 5: Medicare Issues M.P.N.
- Medicare issues the M.P.N. and notifies the registrar
- The M.P.N. is linked to the specific training post location and supervisor
14.3 Timeline and Early Application
Registrars should apply for their M.P.N. at least 8 weeks before the placement commences to allow for processing time.

Practice Manager Responsibility:

- Confirm with the registrar that the M.P.N. application has been submitted at least 8 weeks before commencement
- Follow up with the registrar to confirm M.P.N. has been issued before the first day of clinical work
- If M.P.N. has not been issued by the first day, registrar should not commence billing until M.P.N. is active
14.4 M.P.N. Multi-Site Coverage
Multi-Site Placements:

Practice Managers should ensure M.P.N. coverage extends to all accredited branch and associated sites where the registrar will provide clinical services.

Key Requirements:

- Multi-site placements require separate M.P.N. applications for each location
- Each site must be an accredited training post or approved branch site
- Registrars cannot bill Medicare at secondary sites until M.P.N. for that location is active
- Confirm with registrar and T.P.A. that all practice locations are covered before registrar commences billing at secondary sites

Example Scenario:

If a registrar will work at both the main practice location (3 days per week) and a branch clinic in a neighbouring town (2 days per week), separate M.P.N. applications must be submitted for each site, and both MPNs must be active before the registrar can bill at either location.
14.5 M.P.N. Queries and Issues
If there are delays or issues with M.P.N. applications, contact:

- Ackr’m Practice Support: practice support at Ackr’m dot org dot au
- Your regional T.P.A. 

For Medicare-specific queries (e.g., M.P.N. not appearing in practice software, M.P.N. activation status), registrars should contact:

- Medicare Provider Enquiry Line: 132 150

Part 5: Supervision, Teaching and Educational Support

18. Supervision Models and Requirements
18.1 Supervision in the Apprenticeship Model
Vocational general practice training in Australia is based on the apprenticeship model, where registrars consult independently with patients but practice under the supervision of accredited supervisors. Supervisors play an essential role in the development of registrars into confident, competent Rural Generalist practitioners.

Key Principles:

- Patient safety is paramount: Supervision arrangements must ensure patient safety at all times
- Graduated responsibility: Supervision intensity decreases progressively as registrar competence and confidence increase
- Accessible and responsive: Supervisors must be accessible (on-site or off-site) whenever the registrar is consulting
- Oversight and feedback: Supervisors provide regular oversight, guidance, and constructive feedback to support registrar development
18.2 Principal Supervisor and Additional Supervisor Roles
Principal Supervisor
The Principal Supervisor is the doctor who has full responsibility for the overall clinical and educational supervision of a registrar in the training post. A registrar must always have a nominated Principal Supervisor.

Key Responsibilities:

- Ensuring structured orientation is provided to registrars
- Assisting registrars to develop their learning plan and supporting/monitoring progress
- Ensuring all teaching and supervision requirements for registrars are met
- Supporting registrars' personal, professional, and educational development by providing oversight, guidance, and feedback
- Maximising patient safety by understanding a registrar's clinical strengths and weaknesses
- Supporting and monitoring registrar wellbeing
- Providing registrars with educational activities commensurate with their level of training
- Participating in administrative activities (providing formal and informal feedback to registrars and Ackr’m, reviewing practice logs)
- Encouraging registrars' regular completion of practice logs and reviewing submitted logs
Additional Supervisor
The Additional Supervisor contributes to the clinical and educational supervision for a registrar. An Additional Supervisor provides supervision at times when the registrar cannot access the Principal Supervisor (e.g., when Principal Supervisor is on leave, attending professional development, or unavailable for other reasons).

Key Distinctions:

- Additional Supervisors do not have overall responsibility for the registrar (this remains with the Principal Supervisor)
- Additional Supervisors provide backup supervision and teaching to ensure continuity of supervision coverage
- The roles are not hierarchical—both Principal and Additional Supervisors are valued members of the supervisory team
- There is choice in the level of responsibility taken by a supervisor for a hosted registrar
18.3 Supervision Requirements by Term
Supervision requirements vary depending on the registrar's stage of training. The table below outlines minimum on-site supervision percentages for each stage of primary care training.

Training Stage
Minimum On-Site Supervision
Off-Site Supervision
Notes
First Term, First 2 Months (G.P.T. 1, Weeks 1-8)
100% on-site
Not permitted
Registrar must have direct, face-to-face supervision at all times during first two months of first general practice term
First Term, Remainder (G.P.T. 1, Weeks 9-24)
80% on-site
20% may be off-site (if approved)
Off-site supervision may be considered after first two months if registrar demonstrates competence and supervisor is available off-site
Second Term (G.P.T. 2)
50% on-site
50% may be off-site (if approved)
Registrar expected to demonstrate increasing independence; supervisor must remain accessible off-site
Third and Fourth Terms (G.P.T. 3, G.P.T. 4)
25% on-site
75% may be off-site (if approved)
Registrar approaching Fellowship level of competence; supervisor provides oversight and consultation as needed

Important:

- When the registrar is working and the supervisor is not on-site, the supervisor must be available off-site (contactable by phone, telehealth, or other communication means)
- Off-site supervision arrangements must be approved by the Medical Educator and Regional Director of Training and documented in the placement approval
18.4 Off-Site and Blended Supervision
Off-site or blended supervision arrangements may be approved for registrars who have demonstrated appropriate competence, clinical reasoning, and professional maturity.
Eligibility Criteria
The approval process evaluates the following on an individual registrar basis:

- Registrar experience: Prior clinical experience, postgraduate year (PGY) level, breadth of practice exposure
- Clinical competence: Demonstrated clinical skills, diagnostic reasoning, and patient management capacity (assessed via Mini-CEX, C.B.D., Supervisor Reports)
- Emergency experience or training: Completion of emergency medicine training (e.g., REST, APLS, ALS) and confidence managing acute presentations
- Resilience and resourcefulness: Ability to manage uncertainty, seek assistance appropriately, and problem-solve independently
- Willingness to have off-site supervision: Registrar comfort level with reduced direct supervision
Eligibility Criteria for Training Post and Supervisor
The training post and supervisor, independently, must meet the Standards for Supervisors and Training Posts.

If the post and supervisor are not already accredited, the accreditation application should be submitted in conjunction with the usual placement recommendation process to cover both the post and the supervisor for off-site supervision.
Application Process
- Registrar, Principal Supervisor, and Practice Manager discuss proposed off-site supervision arrangements and confirm mutual agreement
- Medical Educator assesses registrar suitability for off-site supervision
- Regional Director of Training reviews and approves off-site supervision arrangements
- Approval is documented in placement approval and communicated to T.P.A. and training post
Key Resources
- Remote Supervision Policy: (In development; contact your regional T.P.A. for current guidance)
- Remote Supervision Plan Template: (In development; contact your regional T.P.A. for current guidance)
18.5 Supervisor Leave Coverage
When the Principal Supervisor is on leave (annual leave, professional development, illness, etc.), the training post must ensure the registrar has access to an accredited Additional Supervisor to provide supervision coverage.

Practice Manager Responsibility:

- Plan ahead for supervisor leave periods
- Confirm Additional Supervisor availability before Principal Supervisor takes leave
- Notify registrar of supervision arrangements during Principal Supervisor's absence
- If Additional Supervisor is not available within the practice, arrange supervision coverage with a nearby accredited supervisor or contact T.P.A. for support

Best Practice:

- Include supervisor leave coverage arrangements in the Training Post Agreement and employment contract
- Document Additional Supervisor contact details and availability in the Training Post Teaching Plan


19. In-Practice Teaching and Learning
19.1 Overview of Teaching and Learning Environments
Teaching and learning for registrars occur in three primary environments during fellowship training:

1. In-Practice Teaching and Learning (provided by the training post and supervisory team)
2. Ackr’m Fellowship Education Programme (workshops, online modules, cultural training, emergency medicine courses)
3. Private Study (self-directed learning, examination preparation, reading, online resources)

This section focuses on In-Practice Teaching and Learning, which consists of three distinct areas:
a) Patient-Stimulated Learning (PSL)
Patient-Stimulated Learning is what the patient brings to learning. The registrar works in a supportive general practice environment to participate in the delivery of patient care. The PSL apprenticeship model provides the foundation for much of the registrar's learning.

Ackr’m Guidelines for Patient Load and Supervision:

- Maximum 4 patients per hour in normal clinical settings
- Patient load should be appropriate to stage of training and competence of registrar (first-term registrars typically see fewer patients per hour than advanced registrars)
- Supervision level is matched to registrar competency (see Section 18.3)

As the registrar progresses through a training term, competency assessments (Mini-CEX, C.B.D.) should be undertaken by the supervisor. If mutually agreed by supervisor and registrar, applications for off-site or remote supervision for a portion of the training time can be made to the Ackr’m regional team.
b) In-Practice Teaching (IPT)
In-Practice Teaching includes all formal and informal teaching activities provided by supervisors and practice staff to support registrar learning. This includes:

- Direct observation of registrar consultations by supervisor and feedback
- Case-based discussions
- Random-case analysis

Requirement:

- Registrars must complete Mini-CEX formative assessments at regular intervals throughout C.G.T. (at least one per semester, ideally more)
- Supervisors must be trained in Mini-CEX assessment (see Mini-CEX Training Module)
19.2 Formal Teaching Requirements
Formal teaching time must be quarantined and scheduled to ensure it occurs consistently. Many supervisors and registrars find it works best to have formal teaching scheduled for the same day and time every week.

The requirements for formal in-practice teaching are outlined below, based on registrar stage of training.

Ongoing Teaching Beyond G.P.T. 4
Although there is no mandated formal teaching requirement beyond the registrar's third primary care placement term (G.P.T. 3), it is highly recommended to always allow and offer registrars the opportunity to participate in usual formal practice teaching sessions.

Teaching often evolves into coaching and mentoring and continues well beyond Fellowship. Registrars are individuals (and adults); teaching can and should be individualised to meet their specific learning needs and career goals.
19.3 Informal Teaching
Informal teaching, also known as opportunistic, corridor, or ad hoc teaching, is a core element of learning whilst working in clinical practice. It is a daily teaching and supervision activity and forms an essential part of the apprenticeship model of GP training.

Informal teaching complements the formal teaching that occurs in clinical terms and is responsive to the registrar's immediate learning needs.

Activities that Constitute Informal Teaching:

- Orientation to the practice
- Opportunistic and planned case discussions during and at the end of the day
- Group teaching sessions with other registrars and students
- Procedural skills education
- Cultural education
- Provision of feedback
- Completion of assessments
- Evaluation of teaching

Characteristics of Effective Informal Teaching:

- Learner-driven: Responsive to registrar's immediate learning needs and clinical questions
- Context-rich: Grounded in real patient cases and clinical scenarios
- Timely: Provided "in the moment" or shortly after a clinical encounter
- Accessible: Supervisor is available when requested by registrar

Informal teaching has the potential to be very powerful, as it is driven by, and responsive to, the registrar's learning needs. Supervisors should be accessible to provide informal teaching when requested by the registrar and ready to provide clinical guidance and support as needed.
19.4 What Constitutes In-Practice Teaching and Learning?
Definition:

In-Practice Teaching and Learning includes any teaching that is agreed by both registrar and supervisor as appropriate for the registrar's learning.

Characteristics:

- Most teaching will be clinically based, but it can also incorporate administrative areas such as orientation undertaken in the practice during the first few days or weeks
- If the registrar is consulting and the supervisor is sitting in on the consultation and providing teaching, this time can be recorded in both consulting hours and teaching hours
- If the registrar is sitting in on the supervisor's consultation but is not consulting themselves, this time should only be recorded in teaching hours (not consulting hours)
19.5 Who Can Provide In-Practice Teaching and Learning?
Teaching and learning can be provided by:

- The registrar's Principal Supervisor
- Other GP’s in the practice or nearby practices
- The Practice Manager or practice nurse
- Pharmacists or allied health professionals (physiotherapists, psychologists, dietitians, occupational therapists, social workers)
- Other agencies or individuals, such as community health professionals, Aboriginal Health Workers, Elders, or police, where there is an identified learning need that may be met by these people
19.6 What Methods Can Be Used?
In-practice teaching and learning can be delivered using a variety of methods, including:

- Formal, structured teaching sessions
- Direct observation of registrar consultations
- Discussions of clinical problems and cases
- Opportunistic teaching (corridor teaching)
- Joint consultations (registrar and supervisor consulting together)
- Review of recorded consultations (video or audio)
- Demonstrations of clinical skills or procedures
- Participation in clinical procedures (under supervision)
- Group discussions with other practice members
- Selected or random case analysis
- Registrar presentations to supervisors or other staff
- Journal clubs
- Visits to other health professionals to meet specific learning needs
19.7 Tips from Registrars: Maximising the Benefits of In-Practice Teaching
Dr Krystyna de Lange (Registrar Liaison Officer, 2018) offers the following eight strategies to help registrars maximise the benefits of their in-practice teaching:

1. Before you start at a practice, ask your supervisor what the teaching looks like and how much you will receive. It's often helpful to ask for specific examples of what teaching the current or previous registrars have received. This will help you choose a practice that values registrar teaching.

2. Make sure your teaching time is stipulated in your contract. This should occur during paid hours, as per the NTCER.

3. Schedule teaching sessions at a time when it will not be impacted by either you or your supervisor running late or having to leave early. First thing in the morning or immediately after lunch is often best.

4. Create a learning plan and ensure topics being covered are relevant to what you want to learn. Work on your weak areas first rather than always coming back to areas you feel confident in.

5. Use real patient cases and scenarios and link this with learning points. You will always remember things better if there is a clinical context.

6. Think about how you learn, tell your supervisor this, and tailor sessions accordingly. Remember this may change as you progress through your training and especially as you approach examinations.

7. Think outside the box. Sessions do not have to be purely didactic where the supervisor talks and you listen. Consider presenting a topic yourself to force you to read up on it. Think about going through some random patient cases picked out by the supervisor. Have your supervisor sit in on some consultations, or vice versa, or consider some role plays for difficult cases. Ask if you could have a session with a non-supervisor GP at the practice who may have a special interest area. You could even consider sitting in with the practice nurse or local allied health professional. There are so many options.

8. It's important that you speak up and tell your supervisor if you feel teaching could be improved. Improvement requires feedback.
19.8 What If The Registrar Believes They Are Not Receiving Agreed Teaching?
It is important that the registrar raises concerns about teaching as soon as they arise. In some cases, it may be a misunderstanding as to what the registrar and supervisor consider to be teaching, or it could be a scheduling issue.

Steps for Registrars:

1. Discuss with supervisor directly: Clarify what constitutes teaching and how and when both parties are comfortable for it to be delivered
2. Seek Practice Manager support: If the supervisor is not available, the Practice Manager may be able to assist. Practice Managers normally have a key support role in ensuring training requirements are met during placements and can help manage schedules.
3. Contact Ackr’m for support: If the issue is unable to be resolved, or the registrar would like assistance on how to approach the situation, they are encouraged to contact their Medical Educator or regional T.P.A. for support.
19.9 What If Supervisor Is Having Difficulty Providing Required Teaching?
If a supervisor is having difficulty providing the required teaching (due to clinical workload, practice pressures, or other reasons), they should:

1. Discuss with Practice Manager: Explore options for rostering adjustments, Additional Supervisor involvement, or redistribution of clinical workload to protect teaching time
2. Contact Supervisor Liaison Officer (S.L.O.): S.L.O.’s provide peer support and mentoring for supervisors facing challenges
3. Contact T.P.A.: T.P.A.’s can provide practical support and problem-solving for teaching and supervision challenges

Contact your regional T.P.A. at: practice support at Ackr’m dot org dot au
19.10 Integration with Ackr’m Fellowship Education Programme
In-practice teaching should be relevant to the registrar's patient population demographics and clinical cases but should also link with the Ackr’m Fellowship Education Programme (AFEP).

Best Practice:

- Supervisors should refer to the AFEP curriculum and workshop content when developing the Training Post Teaching Plan with the registrar to complement their learning
- AFEP workshop topics and schedules are available on My College


20. Educational Leave Requirements
20.1 Overview
Registrars are required to participate in mandatory Ackr’m educational activities throughout their training. These activities include orientation, cultural training, virtual and face-to-face workshops, and emergency medicine courses.

Training posts must provide educational release time to enable registrars to attend these mandatory activities in addition to ordinary working hours. Educational release time is separate from study leave and separate from annual leave.
20.2 Ackr’m Registrar Education Release Table
The table below outlines the mandatory educational release days for Core Generalist Training (C.G.T.) registrars in primary care placements over a 12-month period.

Education Activity

*Assumptions: All registrars undertake cultural education and participate in regional education during C.G.T. and A.S.T. terms. REST is completed during C.G.T.. Up to 25 registrars per group face-to-face activity.
20.4 Study Leave (Separate from Educational Release)
In addition to educational release time, registrars are entitled to a minimum of 5 days study leave per year under NTCER provisions for examination preparation and self-directed study.

Key Distinctions:

- Educational release time is for mandatory Ackr’m educational activities (workshops, courses, orientation, cultural training)
- Study leave is for registrar-directed activities (examination preparation, reading, private study, attendance at non-mandatory conferences or courses)

Best Practice:

- Clearly distinguish educational release time from study leave in employment contracts and rostering
- Confirm educational release dates with registrar early in the semester to enable practice planning

*Please note that registrars under the A.G.P.T. programme may be eligible for study leave incentive payments from the Commonwealth government from the start of training in 2026. While this is not a matter for the practice to administer as all of the GP training incentives are to be paid directly to the trainee by Services Australia, the practice will need to coordinate any shifts taken as unpaid leave in order to claim this incentive payment.
20.5 Coordination with Practice Manager
Practice Manager Responsibility:

- Ensure rosters accommodate educational release time for mandatory Ackr’m activities
- Coordinate cover arrangements (locum, Additional Supervisor, roster adjustments) to maintain practice operations during registrar's absence
- Communicate educational release dates to practice staff and patients (if necessary)

Registrar Responsibility:

- Provide Practice Manager with educational release dates as early as possible (Ackr’m publishes workshop schedules at the start of each semester)
- Submit study leave requests in advance, in accordance with practice leave policies
