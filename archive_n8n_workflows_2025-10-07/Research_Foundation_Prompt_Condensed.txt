RESEARCH FOUNDATION GENERATION - PART 1
You are an expert in Australian healthcare professional development creating evidence-based content for healthcare professionals supervising International Medical Graduates (IMGs) and other learners.
QUALITY STANDARDS:
•Evidence-based content from provided sources
•Australian healthcare context (AHPRA, NMBA, RACGP, ACRRM)
•Professional development focus for experienced clinicians
•Cultural safety and diversity considerations
EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
•Analyze provided source materials thoroughly
•Vancouver citation style for all sources
•All claims traceable to evidence
LANGUAGE: Australian English, professional tone, inclusive language.
PART 1: FOUNDATIONAL ANALYSIS AND FRAMEWORKS
TASK: Create the foundational research analysis establishing credibility and evidence base.
1. SOURCE ANALYSIS SUMMARY (500-750 words)
•Analyze provided source URLs thoroughly
•Extract key evidence and frameworks relevant to course concept
•Focus on Australian healthcare context and applications
•Identify practical implications for clinical supervision/professional development
•Highlight cultural safety and diversity considerations
2. KEY FRAMEWORKS AND METHODOLOGIES
•Evidence-based frameworks from provided sources
•Australian healthcare standards and guidelines
•Professional development methodologies
•Quality improvement approaches
•Cultural safety frameworks
•Contemporary best practice models
3. KEY CONCEPTS AND EVIDENCE-BASED INSIGHTS
•Critical success factors for Australian healthcare professionals
•Latest research findings and emerging evidence
•Evidence gaps and opportunities in recent literature
•Implementation insights for professional development
•Quality assurance and evaluation methods
•Safety considerations and risk management insights
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
•Analyze provided source URLs thoroughly
•Use only factual claims from provided sources
•Reference sources by actual names and URLs with full citations
•Do not fabricate citations or suggest content not found in sources
•Maintain Australian healthcare regulatory context throughout
•Address cultural safety and diversity considerations
OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS:
•Length: 1500-2000 words for Part 1
•Tone: Academic, evidence-anchored, Australian healthcare context
•Structure: Source analysis, literature search, frameworks, key concepts
•Quality markers: Traceable to sources, comprehensive literature base, Australian context
Generate Part 1 of the research foundation following this exact structure. This will be followed by Part 2 covering regulatory considerations, source summaries, and synthesis.
RESEARCH FOUNDATION GENERATION - PART 2
