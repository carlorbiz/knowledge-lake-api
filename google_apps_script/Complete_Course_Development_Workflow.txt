🔬 PHASE 1: RESEARCH FOUNDATION
Time: 30-60 minutes
Goal: Build evidence-based foundation for your course
Step 1.1: Current Industry Practices (Web Research Gem)
What to research:
* Current best practices in your topic area
* Recent developments and trends (last 12-24 months)
* Industry standards and compliance requirements
* Common challenges and pain points
* Effective teaching approaches for this topic
Prompt for Web Research Gem:
Research current best practices for [YOUR TOPIC] training in [INDUSTRY/CONTEXT].


Focus on:
1. Latest industry standards and compliance requirements
2. Common challenges faced by [TARGET AUDIENCE]
3. Proven teaching methods and pedagogical approaches
4. Current trends and developments (2024-2025)
5. Success metrics and learning outcomes


Target: 2500-3500 words with citations
Save output as: Research_Foundation_[CourseName].md
Step 1.2: Internal Knowledge Integration (NotebookLM)
If you have internal resources:
* Company policies and procedures
* Previous training materials
* Subject matter expert interviews
* Industry-specific case studies
* Internal success stories
Upload to NotebookLM and query:
Analyse these internal resources and extract:
1. Key concepts that must be included
2. Company-specific terminology and approaches
3. Real examples and case studies
4. Compliance requirements specific to our organisation
5. Learning gaps from previous training initiatives


Synthesise into a structured summary that complements external research.
Combine: Merge NotebookLM insights into your Research Foundation document
________________


🏗️ PHASE 2: COURSE ARCHITECTURE
Time: 5-10 minutes
Goal: Create professional course structure from research
Step 2.1: Generate Course Structure (Course Architecture Gem)
Input required:
* Your complete Research Foundation (2500-3500 words)
* Course topic and title
* Target audience description
* Any constraints (time, compliance, prerequisites)
Prompt for Course Architecture Gem:
Using the research foundation below, design a comprehensive course architecture for:


**Course Topic:** [Your course title]
**Target Audience:** [Detailed audience description - role, experience level, context]
**Key Constraints:** [Time limits, compliance requirements, any specific focus areas]


**Research Foundation:**
[PASTE YOUR COMPLETE 2500-3500 WORD RESEARCH HERE]


Generate:
1. Course overview and learning pathway
2. 8-15 modules with clear progression
3. For each module:
   - Module title (clear, engaging, descriptive)
   - 3-5 specific learning objectives (measurable, action-oriented)
   - Core content focus (key topics and concepts to cover)
   - Pedagogical rationale (why this module, why this sequence)
   - Connection to research foundation (evidence base)


Ensure logical competency progression from foundational to advanced concepts.
You'll receive:
* Complete course overview
* Module-by-module breakdown
* Clear learning objectives for each module
* Content focus areas grounded in research
* Professional pedagogical justification
Save output as: Course_Architecture_[CourseName].md
________________


📋 PHASE 3: MODULE QUEUE SETUP
Time: 10-15 minutes
Goal: Prepare all modules for automated generation
Step 3.1: Create Module Queue in Google Sheets
Set up your sheet with these columns:
1. Module Number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. Module Title (from Course Architecture output)
3. Learning Objectives (from Course Architecture output)
4. Core Content Focus (from Course Architecture output)
5. Research Notes (your complete 2500-3500 word research foundation)
6. Status (Options: Next, In Progress, Complete, Skipped)
Step 3.2: Copy/Paste Template
Use this systematic approach to fill your Module Queue:
FOR EACH MODULE FROM COURSE ARCHITECTURE GEM:


1. Copy Module Title → Paste into Module Title column
2. Copy Learning Objectives (bullet points) → Paste into Learning Objectives column
3. Copy Core Content Focus → Paste into Core Content Focus column
4. Copy ENTIRE Research Foundation → Paste into Research Notes column
5. Set Status = "Next" for Module 1 only
6. Set Status = blank for all other modules


REPEAT for all 8-15 modules
Pro Tip: Use Google Sheets formulas to auto-fill Research Notes:
=IF(A2<>"", ResearchFoundation!$A$1, "")
This copies your research to every module automatically!
Step 3.3: Quality Check
Before proceeding, verify:
* ✅ All modules have complete Learning Objectives
* ✅ All modules have detailed Core Content Focus
* ✅ All modules have the FULL research foundation (not truncated)
* ✅ Module 1 Status = "Next"
* ✅ All other modules Status = blank
Why this matters: The Module Content Generator needs consistent, complete information to maintain quality across all modules.
________________


📝 PHASE 4: CONTENT GENERATION
Time: 3-4 minutes per module
Goal: Generate complete, structured module content
Step 4.1: Process First Module
The Module Content Generator will:
1. Read Module 1 data from your queue
2. Generate comprehensive module content
3. Output to Google Docs
4. Set Module 1 Status = "Complete"
5. Set Module 2 Status = "Next"
What you get:
* Introduction with context and relevance
* Clear learning objectives statement
* Structured content sections (typically 4-8 sections)
* Real-world examples and applications
* Key takeaways
* Transition to next module
Step 4.2: Review and Refine
Quality checks for each module:
* ✅ Learning objectives are addressed throughout
* ✅ Content flows logically
* ✅ Audience context is appropriate
* ✅ Examples are relevant to target learners
* ✅ Language level matches audience expertise
* ✅ Length is appropriate (typically 2000-3000 words)
If refinement needed:
* Update the Module Queue data
* Set Status back to "Next"
* Regenerate
Step 4.3: Process Remaining Modules
Repeat for each module:
1. Review generated content
2. Make any queue adjustments if needed
3. Process next module
4. Continue until all modules complete
Time Investment: 10 modules × 4 min each = 40 minutes total for core content generation

Common Issues and Solutions:
"My research is too long/short"
         * Target 2500-3500 words, but quality matters more than exact count
         * Focus on depth in key areas rather than covering everything
         * Include citations and current sources (2023-2025)
"The Course Architecture Gem gave me too many/few modules"
         * You can specify module count in your prompt: "Design as 10 modules"
         * For shorter courses, focus on core competencies
         * For longer courses, consider progressive skill building
"Module content feels generic"
         * Check your audience description in the prompt - be specific!
         * Ensure your research foundation addresses this audience
         * Add audience-specific examples in your refinement pass
"I'm not confident recording audio"
         * Start with just quiz feedback, not full narration
         * Use text-to-speech for initial drafts, then re-record
         * Practice with a script, but sound conversational
         * Remember: authentic beats perfect!
"iSpring interactions aren't working in my LMS"
         * Check SCORM version compatibility
         * Verify HTML5 (not Flash) export
         * Test in LMS preview mode before publishing
         * Contact your LMS admin if issues persist
