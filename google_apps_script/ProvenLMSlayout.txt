Module 1: Introduction to AI Scribes in Australian Healthcare
=============================================================

Slide 1: Welcome and Orientation
- Course aims and format
- Target audience and outcomes
- AI scribes: a disruptive innovation

Voiceover:
"Welcome to Module 1. This course is designed for GP supervisors, registrars, and educators exploring how AI scribes can reshape daily clinical documentation. Let’s demystify this powerful but misunderstood tool."

---

Slide 2: What Is an AI Scribe?
- Definition and core function
- Difference from voice recognition
- Key technologies involved

Voiceover:
"AI scribes use a combination of speech recognition and natural language processing to produce draft clinical notes. They differ from simple dictation tools by understanding clinical intent and structure."

---

Slide 3: Scribes vs Traditional Documentation
- Manual entry fatigue
- Limitations of dictation tools
- What AI scribes add

Voiceover:
"Whereas older tools record word-for-word or rely on templates, AI scribes analyse the conversation contextually. This enables them to structure notes as if written by a human—sometimes too well."

---

Slide 4: Current Platforms in Australia
- Heidi Health
- Lyrebird Health
- Key functionality and integration levels

Voiceover:
"Two major platforms—Heidi Health and Lyrebird—are leading in Australia. Understanding how they work and how they integrate into PMS and EHRs is essential before trialling them."

---

Slide 5: Technology Under the Hood
- Machine learning models
- Prompt engineering
- Data training sets

Voiceover:
"Many scribes are built on large language models—similar to the tech behind ChatGPT. That means strengths in summarisation but weaknesses in clinical reasoning."

---

Slide 6: Clinical Workflow Integration
- Live scribing vs batch review
- Where the scribe 'listens'
- Who checks the output?

Voiceover:
"Scribes can function in real time or in the background. Some tools record while you speak, others process uploaded audio. But none remove your responsibility to verify the final note."

---

Slide 7: Adoption in Australia
- From 3% to 8.24% GP usage
- Trends across metro/rural settings
- Drivers of adoption

Voiceover:
"Despite early hesitancy, uptake has nearly tripled. Rural practices cite note fatigue; urban ones are motivated by registrar support and audit readiness."

---

Slide 8: Benefits Observed
- Time savings (20–40%)
- Improved note structure
- Fewer end-of-day write-ups

Voiceover:
"Clinicians report better work-life balance, clearer documentation, and faster progress note generation when used correctly."

---

Slide 9: Risks and Red Flags
- Over-trust in AI
- Hallucinations and inaccuracies
- Blurred consent

Voiceover:
"AI scribes may sound confident—but that doesn’t mean they’re right. Factual hallucinations are common, and human oversight remains essential."

---

Slide 10: Regulatory Environment
- TGA: not regulated as medical devices
- AHPRA accountability
- RACGP and GPSA statements

Voiceover:
"Even if tools aren’t formally regulated, you are. Professional accountability lies with the treating GP, not the platform."

---

Slide 11: Comparing Tools (Activity)
- Compare Heidi vs Lyrebird
- Identify strengths, limits, and consent pathways
- Consider how this impacts registrar supervision

Voiceover:
"This case-based comparison will help you assess which tools align best with your practice needs—and what policies must be in place to supervise their use safely."

---

Slide 12: Module 1 Reflection
- What excited you?
- What made you pause?
- How ready is your practice?

Voiceover:
"As we conclude Module 1, reflect on where your practice stands in terms of readiness. Is the motivation time-saving? Safety? Teaching support? It’s worth naming your 'why'."
