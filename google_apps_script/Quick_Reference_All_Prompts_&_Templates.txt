Template: Quiz Feedback Narration
Correct Answer:
"Excellent! [Explain why this answer is correct in 1-2 sentences, referencing the module content]. This demonstrates your understanding of [key concept]."
Incorrect Answer:
"Not quite. [Explain the common misconception briefly]. The correct approach is [brief explanation]. Review [specific module section] for more detail."
Example:
Correct: "Excellent! Active listening requires both verbal and non-verbal acknowledgment. By paraphrasing what the customer said, you demonstrate understanding and build trust."


Incorrect: "Not quite. Simply staying silent isn't active listening - it's passive hearing. Active listening requires engagement through paraphrasing, questions, and acknowledgment. Review the 'Elements of Active Listening' section for more detail."

Template: Role Play Introduction Narration
"Welcome to this role play scenario. You are [ROLE], and you're about to [SITUATION].

You'll need to demonstrate [KEY SKILLS] while navigating [CHALLENGE]. 


Remember the key principles from this module: [2-3 KEY CONCEPTS].


When you're ready, click 'Begin' to start the scenario. Good luck!"

"Welcome to this role play scenario. You are Alex, a team leader, and you're about to have a performance conversation with a struggling team member.


Your objective is to identify the root causes of the performance issues and create an action plan together.


You'll need to demonstrate active listening, ask open-ended questions, and maintain a supportive yet honest tone.


Remember the key principles from this module: approach with curiosity not judgment, focus on observable behaviors, and collaborate on solutions.


When you're ready, click 'Begin' to start the scenario. Good luck!"

Good Choice:
"Great choice! [Explain why this response was effective]. This approach [positive outcome]. [Optional: In a real situation, you might also consider...]"
Poor Choice:
"This response might not achieve your goal. [Explain what went wrong]. A more effective approach would be [alternative]. Try again?"
Example:
Good: "Great choice! By asking an open-ended question, you've invited the team member to share their perspective. This approach builds trust and often reveals information you wouldn't get from a direct accusation. In a real situation, you might also consider asking about any challenges outside of work that might be impacting performance."


Poor: "This response might shut down the conversation. Jumping straight to consequences without understanding the root cause often leads to defensiveness rather than improvement. A more effective approach would be to ask about what's changed recently or what barriers they're facing. Try again?"
