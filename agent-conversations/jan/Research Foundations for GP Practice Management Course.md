Think
Carla is asking me to continue with creating research foundations for Modules 7-9 of the GP Training Practice Management course. She's clearly satisfied with the work on Modules 4-6 and wants the same approach. I need to create three more comprehensive research foundations (2,500-3,500 words each) with Vancouver citations, Australian spelling, evidence-based content from 2023-2025 sources, for experienced practice managers. The modules are: - Module 7: Understanding Alternate GP Training Pathways - Module 8: Cultural Diversity and Inclusivity in Training Practices - Module 9: The Practice Manager's Role in Medical Student Placements I should start by researching current Australian sources for Module 7 on alternate GP training pathways, focusing on RVTS, ACRRM Independent Pathway, RACGP Fellowship Support Program, IMG compliance, and RGTS consolidation as she specified. Since I already have good context from the previous modules about GPSA, RACGP, ACRRM etc., I can build on that foundation while focusing on the specific content for each new module.

Absolutely, Carla! I'm delighted to continue with Modules 7-9. Let me begin researching and creating the comprehensive research foundations for these next three modules, maintaining the same rigorous academic standards and Australian focus that worked so well for Modules 4-6.

I'll start with Module 7 on Understanding Alternate GP Training Pathways, then progress through Cultural Diversity and Inclusivity, and finally The Practice Manager's Role in Medical Student Placements. Each will maintain the 2,500-3,500 word count with Vancouver citations and evidence-based Australian sources from 2023-2025.
