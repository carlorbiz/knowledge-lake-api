# Training Post Check-ins
## Training Program Advisor Engagement with Training Posts

**Version:** 2026  
**Effective Date:** January 2026

---

## Purpose

The Training Post Check-in is used for **training post accreditation compliance** and **registrar progression**. Training Posts rely on good communication and support to ensure they are compliant and providing safe learning environments for our registrars. The check-ins promote strong relationships between ACRRM and the Training Post which allow better flow of communication to flag any potential concerns early, before they become bigger issues.

**Note:** These check-ins are additional to the onboarding of a newly accredited training post.

---

## Check-in Objectives

**Training Post check-ins are designed to:**

1. **Maintain accreditation compliance** — Ensure training posts continue to meet ACRRM Standards
2. **Monitor registrar progression** — Verify registrars are receiving appropriate supervision, teaching, and clinical experience
3. **Promote strong relationships** — Build trust and open communication between ACRRM and training posts
4. **Enable early problem resolution** — Identify and address concerns before they escalate into larger issues affecting registrar safety, learning, or training post operations

**Value to Training Posts:**
- Timely support and guidance on policy, funding, and compliance matters
- Recognition and appreciation for contribution to rural medical education
- Access to resources and networks to support registrar training
- Early identification of support needs and challenges

---

## Priority-Based Check-in Schedule

The frequency of check-ins is determined by training post priority level, which is assigned based on factors including:
- Training post accreditation history and compliance record
- Registrar feedback and progression concerns
- Complexity of training environment (multi-site, remote location, new supervisors)
- Support needs indicated by Practice Manager or supervisors

| Priority | Description | Minimum Check-in Schedule |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Priority 1** | High-risk posts with significant concerns or complex support needs (e.g., new posts, compliance issues, registrar concerns) | **Weekly** contact until concerns resolved, then reassess priority level |
| **Priority 2** | Posts requiring enhanced support (e.g., new supervisors, recent accreditation changes, moderate concerns) | **Fortnightly** contact during semester |
| **Priority 3** | Established posts with good compliance and no current concerns | **Standard check-in schedule:** Week 5 CGT Check, mid-semester and end-of-semester reporting follow-up, plus ongoing support as needed |
| **Priority 4** | Highly experienced posts with strong track record, minimal support needs | **Light-touch approach:** Week 5 CGT Check, end-of-semester follow-up, responsive support as requested |

**Note:** Priority levels are dynamic and can change based on emerging concerns or training post circumstances. TPAs should reassess priority levels regularly throughout the semester.

## Standard Check-in Timing and Touchpoints

### Before Registrar Commences

**Upon Approval of Placement Confirmation Form (PCF) and Placement Entry to Aptify**

**TPA Actions:**
- Check training post details are up to date in RGHub (e.g., **Org Site ID in Aptify** — critical for NCP/HPOS funding process)
- Verify Practice Manager and supervisor contact details current
- Confirm accreditation status and expiry dates
- Enter placement in RGHub to trigger funding payments

**Why Organisation Site ID Matters:**

The **Organisation Site ID** links the training post's PRODA account to HPOS, enabling:
- NCP claims for AGPT registrars during CGT
- Flexible Funds claims for AGPT registrars during AST
- **GP Training Incentive Payments claims for RGTS registrars (from Semester 1, 2026)**

**TPA Action:** Confirm Organisation Site ID is recorded in Aptify and Practice Manager has active PRODA/HPOS access.

- Verify employment contract compliance (GPSA/GPRA template, NTCER Version 2025-02)

## Check-in Methods

**Phone Call** (Preferred for Week 5 and Week 22 check-ins)
- Allows for real-time conversation and relationship building
- Enables TPA to ask clarifying questions and probe concerns
- Practice Manager can ask questions and seek guidance
- More effective for complex or sensitive matters

**Email**
- Appropriate for follow-up communications, reminders, policy updates
- Useful for providing documentation (links, templates, resources)
- Can be used for brief check-ins with Priority 3 and Priority 4 posts

**Video Call**
- Alternative to phone call for TPAs and Practice Managers who prefer visual communication
- Useful for building relationships with new training posts or new Practice Managers

**In-Person (Site Visits)**
- Reserved for accreditation site visits or when serious concerns require in-person engagement
- Valuable for building strong relationships and understanding training post context

---

## Mandatory Contact Logging in Aptify

**Each contact with the Training Post and/or Supervisor must be recorded in Aptify as a Contact Log entry.**

This ensures:
- Continuity of support and quality assurance
- Other TPAs can understand the post's history and support needs if TPA changes
- ACRRM can monitor training post engagement and identify support needs
- Compliance with ACRRM internal procedures and quality assurance standards

**Best Practice:**
- Log contact immediately after each interaction
- Include sufficient detail for another TPA to understand context
- Use consistent categories and tags for easy searching
- Record outcomes and follow-up actions required

---
