## Supporting IMGs from Arrival to Fellowship: A Roadmap for Rural GP Success

**General Practice Supervision Australia (GPSA)** is proud to share the outcomes of our landmark research project, *From Arrival to Fellowship: A Roadmap to Support IMGs as a Valued Part of Australia’s Rural GP Workforce*. Funded through the RACGP’s 2025 Education Research Grant and the AGPT program, this work responds to the critical need for evidence-informed strategies that empower IMGs to thrive across every stage of their Australian journey.

### Why This Research Matters

International Medical Graduates (IMGs) make up a significant proportion of Australia’s rural general practice workforce. However, they face a uniquely complex pathway—navigating new systems, cultures, and regulatory requirements while relocating themselves and often their families to unfamiliar communities.

Our research identified three pivotal transition points for IMGs:

1. **Arrival in Australia and acclimatisation**
2. **Settling into rural workplaces and communities**
3. **Training as specialist GPs and integrating into the profession**

Each stage brings challenges, but also powerful opportunities to support IMGs’ comfort, confidence, competence, and ultimately their sense of professional and personal belonging.

---

### What We Did

Using **realist evaluation** and **participatory action research**, we gathered insights from 41 participants across the rural GP training and workforce ecosystem—including IMGs, supervisors, training team members, and decision-makers. Of these, **68% were IMGs**, representing a range of locations, backgrounds, and experiences. Feedback was collected through in-depth interviews, focus groups, and iterative review cycles.

This collaborative approach enabled us to co-design a **comprehensive roadmap**—an actionable, evidence-based strategy suite to guide and enhance IMG integration into rural general practice across Australia.

### Key Outcomes: What the Roadmap Delivers

The roadmap offers a clear, staged framework backed by the lived experience of IMGs and those who support them. It sets out practical, systemic strategies at each stage of the IMG pathway:

#### 🛬 **Stage 1: Arrival and Acclimatisation**

* Centralised, clear guidance on migration, healthcare systems, and life in Australia
* Early career mentoring and rural GP training advice
* Information tailored to IMG families and personal wellbeing

#### 🏥 **Stage 2: Workplace and Community Integration**

* Supportive employment pathways, observerships, and preparedness programs
* Fair, quality supervision with independent oversight and helplines
* Peer support, cultural safety, and structured community connection for doctors and their families

#### 🎓 **Stage 3: Training and Professional Belonging**

* Equitable access to rural GP training and recognition of prior learning
* Ongoing mentorship, flexible training, and formative assessment models
* Opportunities for IMGs to contribute as supervisors, educators, and leaders in their own right

---

### What’s Next?

GPSA will continue advocating for the implementation of these strategies by stakeholders across the rural health training landscape.

While publication of this roadmap on our website is temporarily embargoed pending the upcoming peer-reviewed article in the *Medical Journal of Australia*, we are actively working with partner organisations to:

* Embed these strategies into supervisor education and training
* Inform policy updates through rural workforce agencies and colleges
* Support IMGs directly with tools, mentorship, and community connection initiatives

**We invite all rural health training bodies, supervisors, and policymakers to engage with this work—and help ensure IMGs are not only included in our workforce, but truly valued.**

Supporting IMGs from Arrival to Fellowship: A Roadmap for Rural GP Success
General Practice Supervision Australia (GPSA) is proud to share the outcomes of our landmark research project, From Arrival to Fellowship: A Roadmap to Support IMGs as a Valued Part of Australia's Rural GP Workforce. Funded through the RACGP's 2025 Education Research Grant and the AGPT program, this work responds to the critical need for evidence-informed strategies that empower IMGs to thrive across every stage of their Australian journey.

Why This Research Matters
International Medical Graduates (IMGs) make up a significant proportion of Australia's rural general practice workforce. However, they face a uniquely complex pathway, navigating new systems, cultures, and regulatory requirements while relocating themselves and often their families to unfamiliar communities.

Our research identified three pivotal transition points for IMGs:

First, arrival in Australia and acclimatisation. Second, settling into rural workplaces and communities. Third, training as specialist GPs and integrating into the profession.

Each stage brings challenges, but also powerful opportunities to support IMGs' comfort, confidence, competence, and ultimately their sense of professional and personal belonging.

What We Did
Using realist evaluation and participatory action research, we gathered insights from 41 participants across the rural GP training and workforce ecosystem, including IMGs, supervisors, training team members, and decision-makers. Of these, 68% were IMGs, representing a range of locations, backgrounds, and experiences. Feedback was collected through in-depth interviews, focus groups, and iterative review cycles.

This collaborative approach enabled us to co-design a comprehensive roadmap: an actionable, evidence-based strategy suite to guide and enhance IMG integration into rural general practice across Australia.

Key Outcomes: What the Roadmap Delivers
The roadmap offers a clear, staged framework backed by the lived experience of IMGs and those who support them. It sets out practical, systemic strategies at each stage of the IMG pathway.

Stage 1 focuses on arrival and acclimatisation. This includes centralised, clear guidance on migration, healthcare systems, and life in Australia. Early career mentoring and rural GP training advice form part of this stage, alongside information tailored to IMG families and personal wellbeing.

Stage 2 addresses workplace and community integration through supportive employment pathways, observerships, and preparedness programs. Fair, quality supervision with independent oversight and helplines provides the foundation for peer support, cultural safety, and structured community connection for doctors and their families.

Stage 3 encompasses training and professional belonging. This means equitable access to rural GP training and recognition of prior learning, ongoing mentorship, flexible training, and formative assessment models. Most importantly, it creates opportunities for IMGs to contribute as supervisors, educators, and leaders in their own right.

What's Next?
GPSA will continue advocating for the implementation of these strategies by stakeholders across the rural health training landscape.

While publication of this roadmap on our website is temporarily embargoed pending the upcoming peer-reviewed article in the Medical Journal of Australia, we are actively working with partner organisations to embed these strategies into supervisor education and training, inform policy updates through rural workforce agencies and colleges, and support IMGs directly with tools, mentorship, and community connection initiatives.

We invite all rural health training bodies, supervisors, and policymakers to engage with this work and help ensure IMGs are not only included in our workforce, but truly valued.
