Setting Up Genspark and Notion Integration Settings
Share
how do I set up my Genspark/notion connection? this is set from notions end but I can't see a setting for it in Genspark
I can help you explore your Notion integration with Genspark. Let me first check what Notion documents and pages you currently have access to through your connected account.

Excellent! I can see your Notion workspace is already connected to Genspark, and it looks like you've been quite busy with some fascinating AI integration work. Let me check your "Genspark Integration" page specifically to see what information you might have about the connection setup:

Let me also check the page about the Notion connection issue you mentioned:

Based on what I can see from your Notion workspace, your integration is actually working - I can access your pages and see recent activity. However, you're absolutely right that Genspark doesn't have a visible settings panel for managing these connections from the user interface side.

Here's what I can tell you about the Genspark/Notion connection setup:

How the Connection Works
The Notion integration with Genspark is indeed set up from Notion's end, as you mentioned. This is done through Notion's API and integration system. The connection appears to be working since I can:

Access your workspace - I can see all 20+ pages in your Notion workspace
Read content - I can retrieve and summarise page contents
Search functionality - I can search across your Notion pages
The Setup Process (from Notion's side)
While I can't see the exact setup you used, the typical process involves:

Notion API Integration - Creating an integration in your Notion workspace
Permission Grants - Giving the integration access to specific pages/databases
Token Authentication - Notion generates an API token that Genspark uses
Current Status Assessment
Your connection appears functional, but you mentioned it's "dodgy" in one of your recent notes. The fact that I can access your workspace suggests the basic connection is working, but there might be:

Intermittent connectivity issues
Specific page access problems
Search functionality glitches
Troubleshooting Suggestions
Since there's no Genspark-side settings panel, any adjustments need to be made in Notion:

Check your Notion integrations - Go to Settings & Members → Integrations in your Notion workspace
Verify permissions - Ensure the Genspark integration has access to all pages you want to use
Regenerate tokens - If experiencing issues, you might try disconnecting and reconnecting
Would you like me to help you test the current functionality by trying to access or search for specific content in your Notion workspace? This might help identify exactly what aspects of the connection are working versus what might be "dodgy".

Deep Research
Yay - I might have needed to reopen Genspark for the changes to take effect. Now you are fully loaded and ready to roll, please can you add the below project plan to the "Jan Conversations" DB in a way that will enable Claude and Fred and you to make this automation possible?
