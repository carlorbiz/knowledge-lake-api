Jan, can you please turn this mindmap into an interactive project management tool for the First Nations scoping project I am doing for GPSA as a consultant? By project management, I mean we would like to be able to actually add text boxes for comments /new info and use this as the basis from which the report can be generated after we finish the scoping work

Perfect, Carla! I can see this is a comprehensive mindmap covering Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander GP training supports and challenges. This would make an excellent interactive project management tool for your First Nations scoping project. Let me create a web-based application that transforms this mindmap into an interactive tool where you can add comments, track progress, and ultimately generate reports.

Now I'll create the main HTML interface with interactive mindmap functionality:

Using Tool

Write File
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
...
    <script src="js/comments.js"></script>
    <script src="js/reports.js"></script>
    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
Now I'll create the JavaScript files for functionality. First, the main mindmap logic:

Using Tool
|
Write File
// Mindmap functionality
class MindMapManager {
    constructor() {
...
    }
}

// Initialize mindmap manager
window.mindMapManager = new MindMapManager();
Now I'll create the comments management system:

Using Tool
|
Write File
// Comments management functionality
class CommentsManager {
    constructor() {
...
    }
}

// Initialize comments manager
window.commentsManager = new CommentsManager();
Now I'll create the reports generation functionality:

Using Tool
|
Write File
// Reports generation functionality
class ReportsManager {
    constructor() {
...
    }
}

// Initialize reports manager
window.reportsManager = new ReportsManager();
Now I'll create the main application controller:

Using Tool
|
Write File
// Main application controller
class App {
    constructor() {
...
    showNotification: (message, type, duration) => window.app.showNotification(message, type, duration),
    apiRequest: (endpoint, options) => window.app.apiRequest(endpoint, options)
};

console.log('First Nations GP Training Project Management Tool loaded successfully!');
