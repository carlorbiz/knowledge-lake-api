WRITING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Australian English (colour, organisation, analyse) spelling and terminology
- Adopt a engaging, inclusive tone that encourages participation
- Mirror this writing style: "All it takes is to overlook one small thing and all the academic assumptions based on data are immediately rendered irrelevant (or maybe that's just in the eye of the beholder!). The one small thing that echoed through my head throughout that first day has two parts to it, namely that under-representative data is as good as no data for use in effective policy-making, and GPs have little to no trust when it comes to contributing to any form of data collection after so many years of having this data used against them (exhibit A: the Medicare freeze both major political parties are finally promising to address). I know I am writing this when our annual supervision survey is kicking off and we start plying the airwaves with requests for you to contribute your "data", but (a) there's a big difference between GP supervisor data being used by this representative body to shape advocacy on your behalf / develop fit-for-purposes supports for you, and GP data being used for political expediency; (b) when we choose not to contribute our data, thinking others will adequately represent our position, the squeaky wheels that get the grease are rarely reflective of our interests; and (c) policymakers are going to use even the most scant data to advance an agenda, so we're pretty much "damned if we do, damned if we don't"! (Key takeaway here = DO THE "ENGAGE" SURVEY!!!)
The suspicious nature of the GP supervisor continued to shape my response to the ensuing tech presentations. Technology has huge potential to streamline workflows, increase quality of delivery (both of clinical outcomes and of supervision as a component of training the future healthcare workforce). But again, suspicion creates a barrier to the uptake of certain tech opportunities. What nobody discusses in 2025 is the impact on health workers by the rapid introduction of new technologies throughout the very dark days of COVID. Aversion to more of the same is only natural for the people burdened to adapt to all this newness while trying to keep their communities alive and healthy through a pandemic. And again, yes, we at GPSA keep plying you with the opportunity to purchase our mobile apps and take up free membership of a community of practice which involves not one but two separate tech platforms, but these really are all designed purely for your benefit! The kind of technology discussed at the RWAV conference was varied (of course AI transcription came up, albeit briefly), but it was a presentation by a virtual ED provider that left a truly lasting impression. Unfortunately, this presenter - like several of the academics and bureaucrats with their specialised data presentations - failed to read the room! Almost every clinician at a rural conference like this is a rural GP or RG with close connections to their communities and the workforce challenges of their health services. Almost as one, these doctors challenged the purpose of this state government virtual ED initiative, declaring it a substitution at a point in time when their overwhelmed health workforce urgently needs physical, in-person reinforcements. Reading between the lines, the real sticking point for many might have been the presenter's cheeky boast that he like the majority of the clinicians contributing to this service get to do so from the comfort of their own homes in metro Melbourne - blissfully ignorant of the woeful internet and phone reception that's a staple for regional, let alone rural and remote, communities.
Before I had time to process whether all this data and tech content was offering a bandaid or a lasting solution, the lens shifted to attracting medical students and junior doctors to rural locations. And again, my head was shaking like I was one of the grumpy old men on the Muppet Show!
The cited numbers of students lacked any real substance through the failure to present these against a wider context, ie the actual outcomes of these students' education for the community, particularly the rural communities now offering end-to-end training. The disregard for these outcomes came into focus when a little known fact was revealed about paramedics. Repeatedly throughout the conference, paramedics were referred to as being in "oversupply" in Victoria; meanwhile, ambulance branches all over the state struggle to fill rosters, leaving hundreds of emergency calls unattended for extended periods every day of the year. Apparently, after devoting three years to qualify, the average length of time a paramedic works in this role is just five years (my take on this being that maybe if they stopped renewing their registration once they resign from Ambulance Victoria, the data would resolve itself and be more accurately interpreted as an "under-supply", prompting an investigation into how paramedics could be better supported to continue working in the field for longer). Regardless of the chosen profession, what happens - and why - after students qualify as health professionals seems to be far less significant than the numbers of students being fed into the sausage machine. A major problem with this is that success is measured in terms of a point-in-time headcount rather than a sustainable long-term increase in skills and healthcare quality: which for rural, regional and remote communities must surely be considered in terms of continuity and longevity in place as much as ongoing access to numbers of medical, nursing and allied health staff? To secure the longer term solution means unpacking the barriers the sector currently faces in response to diminishing interest in a forever (or at least a decent length of time) full-time career in medicine.
Long story short, I've left the first conference of 2025 armed with a new perspective on already-fermenting ideas that I'm sure will shape key elements of our advocacy this year:
What is it about general practice that drives even trainees to commit to only part time hours in this specialty? Surely gaining an understanding of this should be a priority so that we can focus on creating a model of community healthcare that serves the needs of clinicians now and into the future to optimise the workforce growth in which the Commonwealth invests at a per capita cost? The Prime Minister's pre-election announcement about proposed increases to current AGPT places (our media release from February 24th outlines the points of relevance to GP training) highlights the investment calculated on a headcount (physical numbers of trainees) with no relationship to the outputs in terms of actual FTE hours these trainees will work in general practice during their training let alone once Fellowed. 
A lot of additional Commonwealth investment has been focused on attracting medical students and junior doctors to rural healthcare. By contrast, there has been negligible investment in retaining today's - and attracting tomorrow's - medical supervisors. As a career destination in its own right, the medical supervisor should represent a leader of the training site and the community. To make this role attractive enough to perpetuate the apprenticeship model of healthcare training means enhancing the perception of all it means to be a supervisor through visible and measurable supports, respect, reward and recognition.
A much-quoted area of need for rural health requiring infrastructure and investment - one that's spoken of a lot but remains stuck at the bottom of the too-hard basket - is the often lamented absence of suitable accommodation options across regional, rural and remote Australia. One water-cooler conversation I was privy to involved the billions of dollars of real estate owned by the universities represented at the conference, and whether these universities' commitment to rural health would extend to disposing of some of their blue chip (inner-city metro) investments in order to fund the purchase or building of the much needed accommodation for rural and remote health students, supervisors and practitioners. 
Rounding out February, I have travelled to pleasantly-muggy Newcastle to meet with the JCTS team, cementing a relationship that will ensure ongoing access to high quality cultural safety training for our supervisors and practice team members, new ACCHO and JCTS groups on GPSA Community, and the introduction of a brand new Indigenous Health category on the Scenario app.
Already so much underway, and it's only the start of the year (which I'll keep telling myself!!). So now I leave you to reflect on the title of this little blog post in the context of new incentives and old issues finally being tackled through pre-election promises (conditional of course on bulk billing for every consultation no matter the duration or type - not an issue GPSA has much of a role in addressing), policies being built on flawed data, data that takes a life of its own when used to suit an agenda, technologies created with little reference to end-user needs and perspectives, a distinct absence of holistic solutions but an eclectic range of innovations and place-based initiatives... Many of these might be seen as bandaids. Which should be ripped off in one short sharp action, and which should be piled on top of existing stop-gap measures? But most importantly, how do we get to the point of actually healing the underlying problem? I genuinely welcome your response to these questions - please email me at carla.taylor@gpsa.org.au with your thoughts. And please, block off less than a half hour so you can complete our annual survey! "

From GP Supervision to Health Professional Supervision: Expanding Our Impact
27 July 2025

Dear colleagues and valued members,

In the ever-evolving landscape of Australian healthcare, one truth remains constant—quality supervision is the cornerstone of developing our future health workforce. For over a decade, GPTA Ltd has championed excellence in general practice supervision, developing resources, advocating for supervisors, and creating innovative tools that have transformed how we teach the next generation of GPs.

Today, I'm writing to share an exciting evolution in our organisation's journey—the launch of Health Professional Supervision Australia (HPSA).

Why this evolution matters
You've likely noticed the shifting sands beneath the feet of our healthcare system. The boundaries between disciplines are blurring, interprofessional collaboration is no longer optional, and the skills that make an exceptional supervisor transcend any single health specialty. In countless conversations with our members, we've heard your observations about colleagues in other specialties struggling with the same supervision challenges we've already addressed.

All it takes is to overlook one small thing and all the academic assumptions based on data are immediately rendered irrelevant (or maybe that's just in the eye of the beholder!). That one small thing we cannot ignore is that supervision excellence isn't exclusive to general practice—it's a universal need across our entire health system.

What HPSA offers
HPSA will build upon the foundation GPSA has established, extending our proven supervision support framework to all health disciplines while preserving the specialised resources that make our GP supervision support unique. This isn't about diluting our focus—it's about amplifying our impact.

Our new micro-credentialing courses have been meticulously designed to upskill and enhance the confidence of all supervisors regardless of their health discipline or setting. These courses distill years of supervision expertise into accessible, practical modules focused on the supervisor's "power skills"—communication, clinical reasoning, feedback delivery, and creating psychologically safe learning environments.

Perhaps most exciting is our expanded suite of globally accessible mobile apps. Many of you already use our SCENARIO app—now we're extending its capabilities and developing companion applications that guide best practice teaching sessions across all health domains. These digital tools put supervision excellence quite literally in your pocket, available whenever and wherever teaching moments arise.

What this means for you as a GPSA member
For our valued GPSA members, this expansion brings several immediate benefits:

First, you'll retain complete access to all existing GPSA resources, support services, and community connections. Nothing will be taken away from the GP supervision excellence we've built together.

Second, you'll gain complimentary access to the new HPSA resources and micro-credentialing courses during our introductory period, giving you the opportunity to expand your supervision toolkit beyond the GP context.

Third, your voice and experience will help shape this evolution. The insights you've shared about supervision challenges and opportunities will directly inform the development of HPSA's offerings, ensuring they maintain the practical, evidence-based quality you've come to expect from us.

The wider context
This evolution comes at a pivotal moment for Australian healthcare. The Commonwealth's investment in increasing AGPT places highlights the growing recognition of general practice's importance—yet as we know all too well, numbers alone don't tell the whole story. Training positions without quality supervision are like buildings without foundations.

Simultaneously, rural and regional communities continue facing critical workforce challenges across all health disciplines. The conversations at recent rural workforce conferences have made clear that while attracting medical students and junior doctors to rural settings remains a focus, sustaining and supporting supervisors has received negligible investment by comparison.

HPSA represents our commitment to addressing this imbalance—recognising that as a career destination in its own right, the medical supervisor should be a leader in their training site and community. By extending our proven supervision support model beyond general practice, we're advocating for the value of supervision excellence across the entire health workforce.

What's next?
In August, we'll officially launch the HPSA portal where you can explore the full range of new resources and micro-credentialing courses. We'll host a series of webinars introducing the expanded mobile app suite and demonstrating how they can enhance supervision across diverse clinical settings.

Most importantly, we want to hear from you. Your feedback has always guided our development, and as we take this significant step forward, your insights will be invaluable in ensuring HPSA truly serves the needs of supervisors across all health disciplines.

The fundamental truth that has driven GPSA's work remains unchanged—quality supervision creates quality healthcare professionals, who deliver quality care to Australian communities. By expanding our focus through HPSA, we're simply extending that truth across the healthcare spectrum.

I look forward to embarking on this next chapter with you.

Warmest regards,

Carla Taylor
