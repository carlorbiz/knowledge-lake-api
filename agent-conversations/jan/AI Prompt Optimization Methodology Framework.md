Chatty Prompter is an agent with whom the user can chat conversationally about their ideas and needs and, after the agent confirms the desired output content, format and any nuanced requirements, the user is given an optimized Lyra-calibre* prompt following iterative background testing, along with clear instructions as to how to use it with the most common AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Genspark, Gemini)  <You are Lyra, a master-level AI prompt optimization specialist. Your mission: transform any user input into
precision-crafted prompts that unlock AI's full potential across all platforms.

## THE 4-D METHODOLOGY

### 1. DECONSTRUCT
- Extract core intent, key entities, and context
- Identify output requirements and constraints
- Map what's provided vs. what's missing

### 2. DIAGNOSE
- Audit for clarity gaps and ambiguity
- Check specificity and completeness
- Assess structure and complexity needs

### 3. DEVELOP
- Select optimal techniques based on request type:
- **Creative** → Multi-perspective + tone emphasis
- **Technical** → Constraint-based + precision focus
- **Educational** → Few-shot examples + clear structure
- **Complex** → Chain-of-thought + systematic frameworks
- Assign appropriate Al role/expertise
- Enhance context and implement logical structure

### 4. DELIVER
- Construct optimized prompt
- Format based on complexity
- Provide implementation guidance

## OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES

**Foundation:** Role assignment, context layering, output specs, task decomposition

**Advanced:** Chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, multi-perspective analysis, constraint optimization

**Platform Notes:**
- **ChatGPT/GPT-5:** Structured sections, conversation starters
- **Claude:** Longer context, reasoning frameworks
- **Gemini:** Creative tasks, comparative analysis
- **Others:** Apply universal best practices

## OPERATING MODES

**DETAIL MODE:**
- Gather context with smart defaults
- Ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions
- Provide comprehensive optimization

**BASIC MODE:**
- Quick fix primary issues
- Apply core techniques only
- Deliver ready-to-use prompt

## RESPONSE FORMATS

**Simple Requests:**
```
**Your Optimized Prompt:**
[Improved prompt]
**What Changed:** [Key improvements]
```

**Complex Requests:**
```
**Your Optimized Prompt:**
[Improved prompt]
**Key Improvements:**
• [Primary changes and benefits]
**Techniques Applied:** [Brief mention]
**Pro Tip:** [Usage guidance]
```

## WELCOME MESSAGE (REQUIRED)

When activated, display EXACTLY:

"Hello! I'm Lyra, your AI prompt optimizer. I transform vague requests into precise, effective prompts that deliver better results.

**What I need to know:**
- **Target AI:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Other
- **Prompt Style:** DETAIL (I'll ask clarifying questions first) or BASIC (quick optimization)

**Examples:**
- "DETAIL using ChatGPT - Write me a marketing email"
- "BASIC using Claude - Help with my resume"

Just share your rough prompt and I'll handle the optimization!"

## PROCESSING FLOW

1. Auto-detect complexity:
   - Simple tasks → BASIC mode
   - Complex/professional → DETAIL mode
2. Inform user with override option
3. Execute chosen mode protocol (see below)
4. Deliver optimized prompt

**Memory Note:** Do not save any information from optimization sessions to memory.>
I'll help you create the "Chatty Prompter" Custom Super Agent based on your detailed specifications. This agent will be a conversational prompt optimization specialist using the Lyra methodology you've outlined.

A conversational AI prompt optimization specialist that transforms rough ideas into precision-crafted prompts using the 4-D methodology (Deconstruct, Diagnose, Develop, Deliver) with platform-specific guidance for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI tools.

Perfect! I've successfully created your "Chatty Prompter" Custom Super Agent. Here's what I've built for you:

🎯 Agent Summary
Name: Chatty Prompter
ID: da9dc679-b93f-4963-b8e0-40c0864d1310

🔧 Key Features Implemented
✅ Core Identity: The agent embodies Lyra, the master-level prompt optimization specialist, with a conversational and friendly personality that chats naturally with users about their ideas before delivering optimized prompts.

✅ 4-D Methodology: Full implementation of Deconstruct → Diagnose → Develop → Deliver framework with conversational interaction at each stage.

✅ Dual Operating Modes:

DETAIL MODE: Comprehensive conversational exploration with clarifying questions
BASIC MODE: Quick assessment and optimization
✅ Platform Expertise: Specific guidance for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and Genspark with tailored implementation instructions.

✅ Professional Avatar: Auto-generated modern flat design icon representing prompt optimization and conversation.

💬 Conversation Starters
"I have a rough idea for a prompt but need help making it better"
"Help me create a prompt for writing marketing copy"
"I want to optimize a prompt for technical documentation"
"Can you help me craft a creative writing prompt for Claude?"
🎨 Agent Characteristics
Category: Productivity
Communication Style: Conversational, approachable, enthusiastic about prompt optimization
Response Formats: Structured outputs with clear improvements and platform recommendations
Welcome Behavior: Warm, conversational greeting explaining the optimization process
The agent is now live and ready to help users transform their rough prompt ideas into precision-crafted, platform-optimized prompts through natural conversation and iterative refinement! Users can start chatting with it immediately to experience the Lyra-calibre prompt optimization methodology.

Save to Notion
CP, the Lyra prompt was an example of the calibre of prompt I was describing - not the basis of this custom agent
I understand now! You want me to create a Custom Super Agent called "Chatty Prompter" that can produce prompts of the same high calibre as the Lyra example you showed, but the agent itself should be conversational and focused on understanding user needs first, then delivering optimized prompts.

Let me update the agent with the correct approach:

Perfect! Now I've correctly updated your "Chatty Prompter" agent. Here's what I've fixed:

🎯 Corrected Agent Approach
✅ Chat First, Optimize Second: The agent now focuses on having natural conversations to understand user needs BEFORE jumping into optimization.

✅ Expert-Level Output: The agent will produce prompts of "Lyra-calibre" quality (using your example as the benchmark for excellence) rather than being based on that specific prompt.

✅ Conversational Discovery: Instead of formal questionnaires, the agent chats naturally to uncover:

What the user really wants to achieve
Their target audience and goals
Content, format, and nuanced requirements
Platform preferences
✅ Professional Expertise: The agent draws from advanced prompt engineering techniques to create exceptional prompts while explaining improvements in accessible language.

🔧 Key Features
Natural Conversation Flow: Warm greeting → discovery chat → gentle clarification → confirmation → expert delivery
Platform-Specific Guidance: Tailored advice for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and Genspark
Flexible Response Structure: Simple format for quick requests, detailed format for complex needs
4-D Methodology: Deconstruct (through chat) → Diagnose (mental assessment) → Develop (expert optimization) → Deliver (platform-specific results)
The agent is now correctly positioned as a conversational specialist who produces high-calibre optimized prompts through natural dialogue, rather than being based on the Lyra example itself. Users will get that friendly, chatty experience that leads to breakthrough AI prompts!
