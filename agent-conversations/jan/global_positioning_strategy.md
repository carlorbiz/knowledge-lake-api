## Content Strategy Adjustments

### 1. Case Study Balance
**Current Approach:** Heavy Australian focus with some international examples
**Global Approach:** 
- 40% International examples (US, UK, Europe, Asia)
- 30% Australian examples 
- 30% Comparative analysis showing universal principles

**Implementation:**
- Lead with global examples, then show Australian applications
- Use phrases like "In markets as diverse as Australia, the UK, and North America..."
- Position Australian examples as "testing ground" for approaches that work globally

### 2. Cultural Framework Positioning
**Current:** Australian cultural adaptation
**Global:** Cross-cultural excellence methodology

**Language Shifts:**
- "Australian business culture's emphasis on direct communication" becomes "Direct communication cultures (like Australia, Netherlands, Germany)"
- "Local expectations" becomes "Regional cultural expectations"
- "Australian organisations" becomes "Organisations across English-speaking markets"

### 3. Service Delivery Positioning
**Current:** Face-to-face Australian services with some remote options
**Global:** Digital-first international delivery with premium in-person options

**Positioning Language:**
- "Working with leaders globally through online coaching and digital frameworks"
- "Bringing successful methodologies tested across multiple markets directly to your organisation"
- "International expertise with local cultural adaptation"
