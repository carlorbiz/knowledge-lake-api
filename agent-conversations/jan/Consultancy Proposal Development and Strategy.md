Consultancy proposal
I'll help you create a consultancy proposal. Since this is a professional business document that will likely need structured formatting, tables, and a polished presentation, I'll create this in HTML format.

Doc Generate
Generate content before line 1, instruction: Create a professional consultancy proposal template for Carla, a 55-year-old Australian businessperson and experienced CEO transitioning from full-time CEO role at GPSA to consulting work. The proposal should be structured for business consulting services, reflecting her expertise in strategic planning, system mapping, corporate writing, and business development. Include sections for executive summary, services offered, methodology, timeline, investment/fees, and terms. Use Australian spelling and professional formatting suitable for copying to Word documents (no bold/italics, asterisks, or hashtags). The tone should be forward-thinking, professional, and reflect her unique positioning as someone who helps businesspeople embrace adversity and health challenges as opportunities for growth. Include her background in health education and current work with GPSA.

Apologies, the logos I provided had no background so you were unable to apply the correct elements. Please incorporate these into the proposal and adjust font size for the body to 11pt and left justify all headings and text.
I'll update the proposal to incorporate the correct logo and adjust the formatting as requested - using the proper logo images, setting body text to 11pt, and left-justifying all headings and text.

Why do I get the message "plugin not available" when trying to export even the markdown file into Word?
The "plugin not available" error when trying to export Markdown to Word typically occurs because:

Missing Export Plugin: Your markdown editor/platform may not have the Word export functionality installed or enabled
Browser Limitations: Some web-based markdown editors can't directly export to Word format
File Format Conversion: Direct markdown-to-Word conversion requires specific plugins or tools
Quick Solutions:
Option 1: Copy and Paste Method
Since I formatted this specifically for easy copying to Word (as you requested):

Select all the markdown content
Copy it (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)
Open Microsoft Word
Paste (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
Word will automatically convert the markdown formatting to proper headings, lists, and tables
Option 2: Use File Format Converter Tool
I can convert this markdown file to Word format for you using the file format converter tool. Would you like me to do this?

Option 3: Manual Conversion
Save the markdown as a .md file
Open it in a tool like Typora, Mark Text, or Pandoc
Export directly to Word from there
The easiest approach is Option 1 - the content is already formatted to paste cleanly into Word with proper formatting. Would you like me to help you with any of these approaches, or shall I convert the file to Word format using the conversion tool?

Save to Notion
Please try Option 2, noting that when I pasted the copied text into Word it returned the formatting to hashtags and asterisks!
I'll convert this Markdown document to Word format using the file format converter tool. First, I need to save this as a markdown file and then convert it to Word format.

Unsupported action: markdown to docx

I see the converter doesn't support markdown to docx conversion directly. Let me try a different approach - I'll create the document in HTML format and then convert it to Word, which should preserve the formatting properly.

Generate content before line 1, instruction: Generate an HTML document that contains the exact same content as the current markdown document. Use proper HTML formatting with headings (h1, h2, h3), paragraphs, lists, and tables. Include all the RWAV proposal content, tables, and CV section with placeholders. Format it as a clean, professional HTML document suitable for conversion to Word format. Use standard HTML elements without complex CSS - just basic structural HTML that will convert well to Word.

Failed to convert file

I apologize for the conversion difficulties. Let me try a different approach. Since the direct conversion methods aren't working, I'll provide you with a clean HTML version that you can easily save and open directly in Microsoft Word. Word can open HTML files and convert them automatically to Word format.

Using Tool

Doc Modify
Modify content, instruction: Simplify the HTML document to use only basic HTML tags that Word can easily import. Remove all CSS styling and external links, and use only standard HTML elements like h1, h2, h3, p, ul, li, table, tr, td, th, strong, and em. Create a clean, simple HTML structure that Word can easily convert to proper Word formatting. Keep all the RWAV proposal content but make it as simple as possible for Word compatibility.
View
Perfect! I've created a simplified HTML version that Word can easily import. Here's what you can do now:

Simple Word Import Method:
Copy the HTML content from the current document (right-click and select all, then copy)
Open Microsoft Word
Go to File → Open
Change the file type dropdown to "All Files" or "Web Page, Filtered"
Paste the HTML code into a new document or save it as an .html file first and then open it
Alternative Simple Method:
Save the current document as an .html file
Right-click the HTML file and select "Open with Microsoft Word"
Word will automatically convert the HTML to Word format with proper:
Headers (H1, H2, H3 become Word heading styles)
Bold text (maintains formatting)
Lists (bullet points convert properly)
Tables (convert to Word tables)
Paragraphs (maintain structure)
What's Different Now:
No complex CSS - just basic HTML that Word understands
Standard HTML elements only (h1, h2, h3, p, ul, li, table, tr, td, th, strong, em)
Clean structure that Word can easily convert to its native formatting
All content preserved - your complete RWAV proposal and CV template
This should eliminate the "hashtags and asterisks" problem you encountered with the markdown paste. The HTML will convert cleanly to proper Word formatting with headings, lists, tables, and text formatting preserved.

Try this approach and let me know if you need any adjustments!

OK, Jan - let's reframe this so we're not rewriting the proposal as a slideshow (they've read the pdf already) but directly tackling those curly questions like how I'd specifically map the project on a week by week basis without overdoing the scoped hours but still managing the level of detail and interaction with client and stakeholders I've offered. This needs to pop as my point of difference in this space - I am sure they will have short listed at least 3 other consultants for this project. I want to include my systems prowess in this presentation too - eg use of Notion as a secure collaborative project space designed to overcome any incompatibility with Microsoft/Google environments while ensuring team and Board have the visibility they specifically need etc. Can you please build in these details and regenerate a powerful presentation for me to drop into Gamma.ai?
You're absolutely right - they need to see your operational excellence and systems thinking, not a rehash of the proposal. Let me create a presentation that showcases your unique project management approach and demonstrates why you're the standout choice.

Modify content, instruction: Completely reframe this presentation to focus on operational excellence and project management mastery rather than repeating the proposal content. Structure it around the "curly questions" they'll definitely ask: 1. Opening: Quick credibility establishment (2 minutes) 2. Project Management Excellence: How you actually deliver complex projects (12 minutes) 3. Systems and Technology Integration: Notion workspace, collaboration tools, stakeholder management (10 minutes) 4. Week-by-Week Project Mapping: Detailed breakdown showing how you manage scope vs hours while delivering comprehensive outcomes (10 minutes) 5. Stakeholder Engagement Mastery: How you handle complex multi-stakeholder environments (4 minutes) 6. Your Point of Difference: What makes you different from other consultants (2 minutes) Make it punchy, specific, and focused on demonstrating operational mastery. Include specific examples of systems, tools, and methodologies. Show them exactly HOW you work, not just WHAT you'll deliver. Remove the generic presentation elements and focus on the nitty-gritty operational details that will set you apart from other consultants. Target this for Gamma.ai format with clear slide breaks and specific talking points.
