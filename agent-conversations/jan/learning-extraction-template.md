## Usage Instructions for Jan

1. **For each conversation summary:**
   - Fill out all relevant sections
   - Use "N/A" for sections that don't apply
   - Be specific with decision rationales and technical details

2. **Save files as:**
   - Format: `[YYYYMMDD]_[topic-slug]_pre-extracted.md`
   - Example: `20251230_notion_automation_workflow_pre-extracted.md`

3. **When you're done:**
   - Give Carla the files (or upload to the jan/ folder)
   - Carla will run the batch ingestion script
   - Learnings will be immediately available, no extraction needed
