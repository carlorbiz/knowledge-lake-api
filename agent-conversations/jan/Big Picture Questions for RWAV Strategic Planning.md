hi Jan, can you please generate 5 "big picture" questions to challenge the RWAV Directors and prepare them to contribute big ideas for our kick off strategic planning brainstorming session in 8 days?
I'd be happy to help you craft some provocative strategic planning questions for the RWAV Directors, Carla. However, I want to ensure I generate the most relevant and impactful questions for your brainstorming session.

Could you provide me with a bit more context about RWAV? Specifically:

What does RWAV stand for and what sector/industry does it operate in?
What are the current key challenges or opportunities the organisation is facing?
Are there any particular strategic themes or areas of focus you want the Directors to explore (e.g., growth, innovation, partnerships, market expansion, digital transformation)?
What's the scope of this strategic planning session - is it annual planning, a major pivot, or responding to specific industry changes?
With this information, I can craft questions that will genuinely challenge their thinking and spark the kind of big-picture discussions that lead to breakthrough strategies rather than incremental tweaks. The best strategic questions are those that make people slightly uncomfortable because they force examination of assumptions and sacred cows.

Perfect! Now I understand the full context. Based on your detailed project plan for RWAV's 2026-2030 Strategic Plan development, here are five provocative "big picture" questions designed to challenge the Directors and spark breakthrough thinking for your kickoff brainstorming session:

Five Strategic Challenge Questions for RWAV Directors
1. The Rural Health Ecosystem Disruption Question: "If we accept that the traditional model of recruiting individual health professionals to fill vacant rural positions is fundamentally unsustainable, what entirely new ecosystem approach could RWAV pioneer that transforms how rural communities access, develop, and retain their health workforce?"

2. The Partnership Power Question: "Given RWAV's proven track record, what would it look like if we flipped from being a service provider to rural communities to becoming the catalyst that empowers rural communities and First Nations partners to lead their own workforce solutions - and how would this shift our entire operating model?"

3. The Technology Leapfrog Question: "While urban health services incrementally adopt digital health, what bold technological leap could RWAV champion that positions rural Victoria as the most innovative health workforce development region in Australia - and what partnerships would we need to abandon or forge to make this happen?"

4. The Influence Amplification Question: "If RWAV's advocacy voice became so influential that we could rewrite one fundamental policy or funding mechanism affecting rural health workforce nationally, what would we change, and how do we build the strategic positioning and evidence base to make this level of impact inevitable?"

5. The Sustainability Reinvention Question: "What if the current funding model disappeared tomorrow - what entirely new value proposition and revenue streams could RWAV develop that would make us not just financially sustainable, but so valuable to the rural health ecosystem that our continued existence becomes non-negotiable?"

These questions are designed to push beyond incremental improvements and force consideration of transformational possibilities. They should make the Directors slightly uncomfortable - which is exactly where breakthrough strategic thinking begins.
