APPROACH TO STRATEGIC PLANNING
I believe strategic planning in today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape requires a bold, evidence-based approach that balances ambitious vision with practical implementation. My methodology combines rigorous analysis of emerging trends with deep stakeholder engagement to ensure strategies are both innovative and achievable.

Contemporary and Bold Thinking Having navigated significant industry disruptions throughout my career, including the evolution of healthcare delivery models and the impact of technology on workforce development, I understand the importance of anticipating change rather than merely responding to it. My approach will identify emerging opportunities that others might overlook while ensuring RWAV remains grounded in its core purpose of supporting rural health workforce development.

Stakeholder-Centered Methodology My experience leading diverse stakeholder groups, from hospital executives to government officials to international business leaders, has taught me that successful strategic planning requires genuine engagement with all voices. I will ensure that the perspectives of rural communities, healthcare providers, and policy makers are authentically represented in the strategic planning process.

DETAILED WORK PLAN
Phase 1: Environmental Scanning and Trend Analysis (Weeks 1-3)

I will conduct comprehensive research into policy, societal, and technological changes affecting rural health workforce development. This analysis will draw on my healthcare sector expertise and research capabilities to identify:

Emerging healthcare delivery models and their workforce implications
Technology trends affecting rural health service delivery
Policy developments at federal and state levels
Demographic and social changes impacting rural communities
International best practices in rural health workforce development
Phase 2: Stakeholder Engagement (Weeks 3-6)

Drawing on my extensive experience in stakeholder consultation, I will design and implement a comprehensive engagement strategy:

Stakeholder Interviews: I will develop a structured interview protocol that explores how RWAV's unique capabilities can address emerging challenges. My approach will ensure conversations are both strategic and practical, drawing out insights that inform bold recommendations.

Survey Development: Building on themes identified in interviews, I will design an online survey that engages RWAV's broader stakeholder community in strategic thinking. My experience with diverse audiences will ensure the survey captures authentic perspectives while maintaining high response rates.

Phase 3: Analysis and Recommendation Development (Weeks 7-9)

I will synthesize findings from environmental scanning and stakeholder engagement to develop bold, innovative recommendations. My analysis will identify strategic themes that position RWAV to lead in rural health workforce development while adapting to changing circumstances.

Phase 4: Engagement and Presentation (Weeks 10-12)

I will facilitate two comprehensive workshops designed to engage RWAV stakeholders in strategic thinking:

A staff workshop that harnesses internal expertise and builds commitment to strategic directions
A Board and Executive session that presents findings and recommendations while proposing an effective structure for the Strategic Plan
Throughout the project, I will participate in weekly management meetings to ensure alignment and provide regular updates on progress and emerging insights.

PROPOSAL FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING CONSULTANCY SERVICES

Development of the 2026-2030 Rural Workforce Agency Victoria Strategic Plan

Submitted to: Kate Temby, General Manager, Strategy and Partnerships
Submitted by: Carla Taylor, Executive Lead for Special Projects, GPSA
Date: 30 June 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Having reviewed RWAV's impressive 2023-2024 achievements and understanding the complex challenges you face in supporting Victoria's rural health workforce, I am excited to submit this proposal for your 2026-2030 strategic planning process. Your recent success in placing 29 doctors in ongoing roles (a 66% increase), supporting 291 services through outreach programs, and awarding over $1.8M in mental health workforce incentives demonstrates the critical impact of your work. However, with one-quarter of the rural workforce intending to leave within five years and persistent gaps in mental health, GP, nursing, and allied health services, the next strategic period will be pivotal.

My experience leading strategic transformation in healthcare organizations, combined with my deep understanding of rural health challenges through my work with GPSA and Monash University research, positions me to help RWAV navigate the evolving landscape while building on your strong foundation of place-based solutions and First Nations partnerships.

UNDERSTANDING RWAV'S CURRENT STRATEGIC CONTEXT
Building on Proven Success

Your 2023-25 Strategic Plan has delivered tangible results across all eight strategic goals. The 60% placement rate in MMM4+ communities, the growth in outreach visits to 3,227 serving 47,787 patients (including 10,728 First Nations people), and the expansion of your mental health workforce support to 160 placements demonstrate your organization's capacity to deliver targeted solutions where they are most needed.

Addressing Critical Workforce Realities

The Victorian Rural Health Workforce Census findings paint a clear picture of the challenges ahead. With significant workforce shortages identified in your hotspot regions including Rutherglen, Horsham, Omeo, and Bairnsdale, and primary retention barriers centered on remuneration, burnout, and lack of professional development support, your next strategic plan must address both immediate workforce gaps and long-term sustainability.

Leveraging Innovation and Technology

Your recognition that "innovation will be key to addressing these challenges" aligns with my experience in implementing digital solutions and new service delivery models. The digital divide affecting 10% of rural Victorians with connectivity issues during work hours presents both a challenge and an opportunity for innovative workforce support approaches.

Strengthening First Nations Partnerships

Your commitment to cultural safety and partnerships with VACCHO and Aboriginal Community Controlled Organizations reflects best practice in rural health workforce development. Having observed the critical importance of these relationships in my GP supervision work, I understand that authentic engagement with First Nations communities must remain central to your strategic direction.

STRATEGIC PLANNING APPROACH TAILORED TO RWAV'S NEEDS
Phase 1: Future-Focused Environmental Analysis (Weeks 1-3)

Building on RWAV's strong data capabilities evidenced by your comprehensive workforce census and hotspot analysis, I will conduct targeted research focusing on:

Healthcare Delivery Evolution: Analysis of multidisciplinary team models, digital health integration, and primary-tertiary care pathways that align with your advocacy for moving beyond fee-for-service models

Policy and Funding Landscape: Examination of emerging state and federal initiatives that could support your goal of finding new funding channels, particularly for place-based workforce solutions and First Nations health services

Technology and Innovation Opportunities: Assessment of digital platforms, telehealth expansion, and workforce management technologies that could enhance your outreach programs and professional development offerings

Rural Community Sustainability: Analysis of infrastructure development, housing initiatives, and social determinants that impact your ability to attract and retain health professionals in your identified hotspot regions

Phase 2: Comprehensive Stakeholder Engagement (Weeks 3-6)

Drawing from your established relationships with PHNs, health departments, and community organizations, I will design engagement strategies that build on your existing networks while exploring new partnership opportunities:

Strategic Stakeholder Interviews: Targeted conversations with representatives from your hotspot communities, current program participants, and emerging workforce leaders to understand evolving needs and opportunities

First Nations Leadership Engagement: Dedicated consultation with VACCHO partners and Aboriginal Community Controlled Organizations to ensure cultural safety and self-determination remain central to strategic planning

Innovation and Technology Focus: Specific exploration of digital health opportunities, workforce management platforms, and innovative service delivery models that align with your commitment to contemporary solutions

Policy and System Integration: Engagement with state and federal stakeholders to understand reform directions and identify opportunities for RWAV leadership in system change

Phase 3: Strategic Analysis and Bold Recommendation Development (Weeks 7-9)

Building on RWAV's evidence-based approach and commitment to place-based solutions, I will develop recommendations that address:

Workforce Pipeline Enhancement: Strategies to build on your successful Rural Ambassador Program and DR JuMP initiatives while addressing the aging workforce challenge

Technology-Enabled Service Delivery: Recommendations for digital platforms that could enhance your outreach programs and professional development offerings while addressing connectivity challenges

Integrated Care Models: Approaches to multidisciplinary team development that leverage your existing allied health and GP programs while creating new collaboration opportunities

Advocacy and Policy Leadership: Strategies to amplify your voice in healthcare reform discussions and position RWAV as a thought leader in rural workforce innovation

Financial Sustainability: Diversified funding strategies that support your goal of finding new funding channels while ensuring program sustainability

Staff Strategy Workshop: A comprehensive session that engages your team in translating strategic recommendations into operational initiatives, building on your proven capacity for program delivery and innovation

Board and Executive Presentation: A strategic briefing that positions RWAV for continued leadership in rural health workforce development while addressing the complex challenges ahead
