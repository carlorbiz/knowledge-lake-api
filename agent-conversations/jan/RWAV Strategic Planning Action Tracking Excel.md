Save to Notion
Is this compatible with Notion?
Great question! The interactive workspace I created is Notion-inspired but not directly compatible with importing into actual Notion. However, I can create something that IS compatible with Notion! Let me give you both options:

Option 1: Direct Notion Database Setup 📋
I can create CSV exports that you can import directly into Notion databases. Notion accepts CSV imports for creating databases with all your data.

Using Tool
|
Generate and Execute Python Code
Create multiple CSV files optimized for Notion database import. Format the data from all our RWAV strategic planning tables (Dashboard Summary, Action Items Register, Six Paths Opportunities, Stakeholder Engagement Log, Strategic Initiative Progress, Timeline Milestones) into separate CSV files that can be directly imported into Notion databases. Include proper Notion-compatible column types (Select options for Status fields, Date formats, Number formats, Multi-select for tags, etc.). Add Notion database templates with proper property configurations for each database type. Export each as a separate CSV file ready for Notion import, and create a setup guide showing exactly how to import each into Notion with the correct database properties configured.

Perfect! Now you have both options - let me break this down clearly:

🎯 YES! This IS Compatible with Notion!
I just created 6 CSV files that you can import directly into Notion, plus a complete setup guide. Here's what you now have:

Option A: Direct Notion Import ✅ RECOMMENDED
6 Ready-to-Import CSV Files:

📊 Dashboard Summary - 10 executive KPIs
📋 Action Items Register - 10 strategic actions (348 hours total)
🎯 Six Paths Opportunities - 6 blue ocean opportunities ($1.3M potential)
👥 Stakeholder Engagement Log - 5 key relationships
📈 Strategic Initiative Progress - 4 major projects ($1.75M budget)
⏰ Timeline Milestones - 5 critical project phases
Plus: Complete Notion Setup Guide with step-by-step import instructions

Option B: Standalone Interactive Workspace
The Notion-style web app I created earlier: https://ewylgbhm.gensparkspace.com/

🚀 For Your Board Meeting Next Week:
If You Use Notion (Recommended):
Import the CSV files into your Notion workspace
Follow the setup guide to configure proper database properties
Share with your board for collaborative editing
Use Notion's mobile app during the meeting
If You Don't Use Notion:
Use the interactive web app for the meeting
Export data afterwards to whatever system RWAV prefers
💡 Which Should You Choose?
Choose Notion Import If:

✅ RWAV already uses Notion
✅ You want long-term collaborative strategic planning
✅ Board members are familiar with Notion
✅ You need mobile access and offline sync
Choose the Web App If:

✅ You need something immediately without setup
✅ RWAV doesn't use Notion
✅ You want a one-time presentation tool
✅ You prefer no software dependencies
🔥 The Notion Setup is POWERFUL:
All your data is properly formatted for Notion with:

✅ Select fields for Status, Priority, Risk Level
✅ Date fields for Due Dates and Timeline
✅ Number fields for Progress %, Budgets
✅ Multi-select tags for categorization
✅ Rich text for detailed descriptions
✅ Relationship fields to link databases together
Want me to walk you through importing into Notion, or would you prefer to use the standalone web app for now?

The beauty is you have both options ready to go! 🎯
