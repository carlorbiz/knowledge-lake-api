* Strategic context and methodology  
* Six major strategic themes based on survey analysis  
* Strategic implications specifically for RWAV

* Stakeholder engagement opportunities  
* Clear conclusion with call to action

**Key Strategic Themes Identified:**

* **Funding and Resource Inadequacy** \- Addressing fragmented funding and infrastructure needs  
* **Service Delivery Transformation** \- Recognition of expanded roles and community-based care  
* **Collaboration and Governance** \- Community co-design and stakeholder engagement  
* **Innovation and System Reform** \- Regulatory barriers and new care models
