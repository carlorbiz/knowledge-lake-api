Jan, we need to reframe this now as a contract between me Carla Taylor t/as Carlorbiz, ABN 59 986 624 144, and GPSA In this contract we need to address the issues/requests raised by GPSA's Interim CEO: 1. Unfinished sentence in key project value box 2. Mention of '4 cohorts' under primary deliverables needs explanation 3. A space for each of us to sign/date (03 Sep) 4. A documented payment schedule: I would suggest 30% up front, 30% at the end of October (after mid term report), 40% on presentation of the final report? To be paid within 10 days of production on invoices. GPTAC have specifically requested that all project payments be made prior to the 31 December GPTAC deadline (hence final invoice to be by 21 December please). 5. Final report to be branded GPSA / GPRA ... produced by funding provided from GPTAC. 6. Mention that IP remains with GPSA with appropriate attribution for GPRA and Carla Taylor t/as Carlorbiz (the project team along with GPSA), and the Australian Government Department of Health, Disability and Ageing (the funder) 7. Can you please include a specific mention of your liaising / leading / briefing of GPRA person(s). Can you please use the same formatting I have used for the attached, without the Carlorbiz branding (please leave plain but use my style choices if possible)
I'll convert this into a proper contract between you and GPSA, addressing all the Interim CEO's requests and using the formatting style from your uploaded document.

Brilliant, thanks Jan
You're very welcome, Carla!

The contract now comprehensively addresses all of the Interim CEO's concerns and sets up a professional framework for your consultancy work with GPSA. Having everything clearly documented - from the payment schedule to the GPRA liaison responsibilities to the IP arrangements - should make the project run much more smoothly.

Best of luck with getting it signed and kicking off this important project. The First Nations GP support mapping work is going to provide valuable insights for the sector, and you've structured it well to deliver quality outcomes even within the tight constraints.

Let me know if you need any adjustments or have other aspects of the project to tackle! 🎯

Jan, given your involvement in this project plan, how would you summarise the project goals and target cohort for people I am trying to recruit to help with data collection 
Based on the contract and our discussions, here's how I'd summarise the project for potential data collection helpers:

Project Summary: First Nations GP Support Mapping
What we're doing: We're creating the first comprehensive map of all support resources available to Indigenous doctors and doctors working in Indigenous health settings across Australia. This isn't just about Aboriginal health services - we're looking at the entire ecosystem where First Nations medical training and supervision happens.

Who we're researching (the 4 key groups):

Indigenous GP supervisors working anywhere in Australia
Any GP supervisors working in Indigenous health settings
Indigenous GP registrars training anywhere in Australia
Any GP registrars training in Indigenous health settings
Settings we're covering:

Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs)
Mainstream general practices with Indigenous doctors
Private clinics, hospitals, universities, training colleges
Government health services - basically anywhere Indigenous medical training happens
Our approach:

Respectful engagement - we're not "studying" communities, we're facilitating knowledge sharing
Comprehensive scope - mapping supports across all practice settings, not just Aboriginal health services
Collaborative methodology - working with GPRA as equal partners
AI-enhanced analysis - using advanced tools to synthesise findings efficiently
Why this matters: There's currently no systematic understanding of what support resources exist for these four cohorts. This mapping will identify gaps, highlight successful models, and inform policy decisions that could significantly improve Indigenous medical training and retention.

Timeline pressure: We have just 16 weeks to deliver this (ending 31 Dec 2025), which means we need efficient, focused data collection during a period when many stakeholders will be unavailable due to conferences and holidays.

Your role would involve: Helping facilitate respectful conversations with stakeholders who have knowledge about supports for these cohorts, using our interactive toolkit that empowers participants to share their expertise rather than feeling surveyed.

Does this capture what you'd want potential helpers to understand?

That's great - now how do we reframe this for the community contacts themselves?
For the community contacts, we need to completely reframe this from a formal contract to a respectful, empowering invitation that positions them as knowledge leaders and partners. Here's how I'd approach it:

Doc Generate
Generate content before line 1, instruction: Create a respectful, culturally appropriate invitation document for Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs) and other First Nations health services to participate in the GP Support Mapping Project. Key messaging approach: - Position contacts as knowledge leaders and experts, not research subjects - Emphasise this is about capturing and valuing their existing knowledge - Make it clear they're helping to influence policy and resource allocation - Use respectful, non-academic language that acknowledges their expertise - Include Acknowledgement of Country - Explain the four cohorts in plain language relevant to their experience - Show how their input will directly benefit their communities - Offer flexible participation options (phone, video, in-person if possible) - Make it clear this is a brief, respectful conversation, not a lengthy survey Structure as: 1. Acknowledgement and respectful introduction 2. Why their knowledge matters 3. What we're trying to understand (the 4 groups in plain language) 4. How we'll use their insights 5. What participation looks like 6. Contact information and next steps Use warm, collaborative tone that reflects genuine respect for their expertise and time. Keep it concise and focused on the value they bring.

Perfect! I've created a respectful, empowering invitation for community contacts that completely reframes the approach. Here are the key changes:

Respectful Reframing:
✅ "Knowledge Leaders" not "Research Subjects" - Positions them as experts whose insights matter

✅ Policy Impact Focus - Makes it clear their input will directly influence government funding and resource decisions

✅ Cultural Respect - Includes proper Acknowledgement of Country and recognises Indigenous health knowledge systems

✅ Plain Language - Explains the four cohorts in terms relevant to their daily experience rather than academic categories

✅ Empowering Tone - "Your voice needs to be part of these conversations" rather than "we need data from you"

Key Messaging Changes:
From: "We're researching support structures"

To: "You know better than anyone what support these doctors need"

From: "Data collection for our project"

To: "Your opportunity to influence policy from the ground up"

From: "Survey participation"

To: "Respectful conversation sharing your expertise"

Practical Elements:
✅ Flexible participation - 30-45 minutes, their preferred format ✅ No homework - they don't need to prepare materials ✅ Interactive approach - using the toolkit to capture their priorities ✅ Genuine appreciation - acknowledges their time is valuable

This invitation makes it clear that you're facilitating their knowledge sharing to influence policy, not extracting data for your project. Much more appropriate for respectful First Nations engagement.
