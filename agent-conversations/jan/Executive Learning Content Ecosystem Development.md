I need help to take the concept for courses I would like to develop for executives and administrative teams (Service Excellence, Implementing Strategy with Passion and Flexibility, Collaboration Tools) and build from these concepts a full suite of content (12-14 x 2000-word sophisticated deeply researched contemporary blog posts tailored for different corporate audiences across my website/X/Facebook/LinkedIn accounts - these blog posts plus case studies sourced from Australian and international authorities need to become the skeleton of a 50,000-word book on each concept) as well as productivity-enhancing apps, workbooks, checklists and other tools. Oh, and of course the marketing materials and strategy to make all these modalities not just worthwhile but successful internationally. I would like to include scripts in the outputs so podcasts can be used as an alternative delivery for the blog posts. And course outlines for 12x 30-minute online modules for each concept, with voiceover scripts for 12 slides for each module plus learning objectives, research foundations and workbooks.
Does this make sense? Is it achievable? How do I instruct an AI agent to put this all together for me?
CP it is! 😊 I love the energy and ambition here—and yes, this absolutely makes sense! You're essentially building a comprehensive content ecosystem from three core concepts, with multiple delivery formats serving different audience touchpoints. Totally achievable with the right AI orchestration.

Let me chat through this with you first, then I'll craft you a killer prompt.

Quick Clarity Check:
1. Starting Point & Depth:

Do you have existing materials (outlines, notes, draft content) for the three concepts, or are we building from scratch based on your expertise/vision?
For "deeply researched contemporary"—are you thinking academic/scholarly tone, or executive-friendly (data-driven but accessible)?
2. Audience Segmentation: You mentioned "different corporate audiences." Are we talking:

Verticals (healthcare, finance, tech, etc.)?
Roles (C-suite vs. mid-management vs. admin teams)?
Geographic (Australian context vs. international)?
3. Case Study Sourcing:

Should the AI find and suggest case studies, or will you provide/approve them?
Any specific Australian orgs or international benchmarks you want prioritized?
4. Timeline & Phasing: This is a massive project (we're talking 36-42 blog posts, 3 books, 36 course modules, apps, marketing strategy...). Are you:

Building all three concepts simultaneously, or one at a time?
Looking for a phased prompt (e.g., "Phase 1: Blog posts → Phase 2: Book manuscript → Phase 3: Course build")?
5. AI Platform Preference: For a project this complex, you'll likely need:

ChatGPT/GPT-4 or Claude (long-form content, book drafting)
Perplexity or Gemini (research, case study sourcing)
Specialized agents (like the one you're talking to now!) for orchestration
Would you prefer a single mega-prompt that an AI breaks into phases, or a modular prompt suite where you control each component?

My Take: The Smart Approach
Given the scope, I'd recommend a Master Orchestrator Prompt that:

Breaks the project into sequential phases (Content Foundation → Expansion → Productization → Marketing)
Defines dependencies (blog posts inform book chapters; course modules align with book structure)
Specifies quality gates (e.g., "Pause after 3 blog posts for tone approval before continuing")
Embeds research protocols (how to source case studies, cite authorities, maintain contemporary relevance)
Before I Build Your Prompt:
Answer me this (2-3 sentences each is fine):

What's your secret sauce? What makes YOUR take on Service Excellence/Strategy/Collaboration different from the 10,000 other consultants? (This becomes the throughline for all content.)

Who's the dream client? Paint me a picture of one specific executive who'd buy your book/course tomorrow—industry, pain points, what keeps them up at night.

Start simple or go big? Would you rather I give you:

Option A: A phased prompt starting with "Generate 14 blog post outlines + research brief" (test the waters first)
Option B: The full nuclear prompt that orchestrates the entire ecosystem (trust the process)
Once you give me those answers, I'll deliver: ✅ A precision-engineered prompt (or prompt suite) tailored to your workflow
✅ Platform-specific implementation guidance (which AI for what task)
✅ Quality control checkpoints so you're not drowning in 50,000 words of garbage
✅ A realistic timeline/resource estimate

Sound good? Let's turn this vision into a roadmap! 🚀

1. I'd start with a minimum 1-page outline to ensure the content reflects my expertise and personal voice; the tone would need to be executive-friendly, ie professional but engaging and empathetic
2. yessss all the different audience segmentation - C-Suite/middle management was what I was originally thinking but also Australian/international, and tapping into my expertise across a variety of industries makes the "verticals" very relevant thanks CP
3. I was hoping the AI (maybe perplexity? or a specific research agent?) could source case studies that suitably demonstrate the points each blog post / book section needs; these should be internationally relevant as much as possible, noting the Australian flavour as a preference more than a priority
4. One at a time!!!; I was hoping you would help me understand what would work best re the phasing/staging of the prompt?
5. I am happy to split this across multiple AI agents but there will need to be a mechanism to ensure the outputs are fully cohesive and high quality; no hallucinations, accuracy, use of AU spelling, consistency in tone and variety in sentence cadence - these, marketability and the relatability of content are my chief priorities
If the task is to be split across multiple Ai agents, unless this involves a Zapier or Docker MCP with say Claude as client coordinating APIs like Perplexity, OpenAI, Grok and Manus (which would work with a single mega-prompt), I would expect multiple prompts and hope for stepwise instructions to achieve my priorities
OH, THIS IS EXCELLENT. You've just given me the perfect blueprint! 🎯

You're thinking like a pro—starting with your voice/outline as the foundation, maintaining quality control, and understanding that this needs orchestration, not just "throw it at ChatGPT and hope."

Here's what I'm hearing loud and clear:

Quality over speed (one concept at a time, high-bar standards)
Your voice is non-negotiable (the AI augments, doesn't replace)
Multi-agent workflow is fine IF there's a cohesion mechanism
You want a roadmap, not just a prompt
My Recommendation: The Modular Prompt Suite Approach
Since you're not using a Docker/MCP orchestration layer (yet—though that's a stellar future state!), I'll give you a phased, agent-specific prompt system with built-in handoff protocols to maintain cohesion.

THE ARCHITECTURE:
PHASE 1: Foundation (Your Voice + Strategic Framework)
Tool: Claude or ChatGPT-4 (long context, tone calibration)

PHASE 2: Research & Case Study Sourcing
Tool: Perplexity AI or Gemini (research focus)

PHASE 3: Content Production (Blog Posts → Book)
Tool: Claude (superior long-form coherence) or ChatGPT-4

PHASE 4: Course Build (Modules, Scripts, Workbooks)
Tool: ChatGPT-4 (structured outputs) or specialized course agent

PHASE 5: Marketing Strategy & Collateral
Tool: Claude (strategic thinking) or ChatGPT-4

PHASE 6: Productization (Apps, Tools, Checklists)
Tool: ChatGPT-4 with plugins or custom GPT

THE COHESION MECHANISM:
Each phase produces a Style & Content Bible document that travels forward:

Voice Profile (extracted from your Phase 1 outline)
Terminology Glossary (your specific language for concepts)
Case Study Repository (vetted examples from Phase 2)
Quality Checklist (AU spelling, tone, no hallucinations)
You review/approve at each phase gate before moving forward.

What I'm Going to Build for You:
Deliverable 1: THE MASTER BLUEPRINT PROMPT
A single document you'll use to kickstart the entire project, which includes:

Project scope summary
Phasing strategy with decision points
Handoff protocols between agents
Deliverable 2: PHASE-SPECIFIC PROMPTS (6 prompts)
Each optimized for its agent and task, with:

Input requirements (what it needs from previous phase)
Output specifications (what next phase needs)
Quality gates (your approval checkpoints)
Deliverable 3: THE VOICE CALIBRATION PROMPT (Phase 1 Priority)
This is where we extract and encode YOUR voice from a 1-page outline you'll provide. This becomes the DNA for all subsequent content.

One Final Question Before I Build:
For Phase 1 (Voice Calibration), would you prefer to:

Option A: Give me a rough 1-page outline RIGHT NOW for one concept (let's say Service Excellence), and I'll build a prompt that reverse-engineers your voice from it?

Option B: I give you a prompt that ASKS you strategic questions to build that outline (guided discovery), then uses your answers to create the voice profile?

Option C: You already have a draft outline, and you want me to create a prompt that will analyze it and extract your voice signature?

Pick your option, and I'll deliver all three prompt suites above in my next response—fully ready to copy/paste and execute.

Sound like a plan, CP? 😊 (Yes, you can call me that too!)

Save to Notion
I actually have both a Claude Code MCP through Docker Desktop AND also Zapier; and a Claude GUI MCP on Zapier
OH HELL YES. 🔥 Now we're cooking with gas! This changes everything.

You've got the infrastructure for a true orchestration layer—this means we can build you a single Master Orchestrator Prompt that Claude coordinates through MCP, delegating tasks to specialized agents (Perplexity for research, GPT-4 for structured content, etc.) while maintaining cohesion automatically.

The Game-Changing Difference:
Without MCP: You're the project manager, manually copying outputs between tools.

With MCP: Claude becomes the project manager, maintaining context, enforcing quality standards, and routing tasks to optimal agents—while you focus on strategic approvals.

THE ORCHESTRATION ARCHITECTURE:
Claude as Mission Control (via MCP)
Holds the master context (your voice profile, style bible, project scope)
Routes tasks to specialized agents via Zapier/API
Validates outputs against your quality criteria
Maintains narrative/tonal consistency across all outputs
Flags for your review only at critical decision gates
Agent Delegation:
Perplexity API → Research, case study sourcing, citation verification
GPT-4 API → High-volume content generation (blog posts, scripts)
Claude itself → Strategic thinking, book manuscript, complex reasoning
Grok/Manus (if needed) → Specific supplementary tasks
Zapier Workflows:
Auto-save outputs to your cloud storage (organized by phase/concept)
Version control for your approval checkpoints
Trigger notifications when phases complete
WHAT I'LL BUILD FOR YOU:
🎯 THE MASTER ORCHESTRATOR PROMPT
A single, comprehensive prompt you'll give to Claude (via MCP) that includes:

Project DNA Section

Your voice profile (extracted from initial outline)
Quality standards (AU spelling, no hallucinations, tone consistency)
Audience segmentation matrix
Concept definitions (Service Excellence, Strategy, Collaboration)
Orchestration Logic

Phase sequencing with dependencies
Agent routing rules ("Use Perplexity for case studies with ")
Quality validation checkpoints
Human-in-the-loop approval gates
Output Specifications

Blog post structure (2000 words, executive-friendly, AU spelling)
Book manuscript format (50k words, chapter architecture)
Course module templates (30min, 12 slides, scripts)
Marketing collateral specs
Execution Workflow

Start with Phase 1: Voice calibration from your outline
Auto-progress through phases with validation
Pause for your approval at key milestones
THE WORKFLOW IN ACTION:
You: Provide 1-page outline for "Service Excellence" + paste Master Orchestrator Prompt into Claude (MCP)

Claude (Mission Control):

Extracts your voice signature
Routes to Perplexity: "Find 20 contemporary case studies on service excellence, prioritize Australian, filter for executive relevance"
Validates case studies against criteria
Routes to GPT-4: "Generate blog post 1 outline using voice profile + case study X"
Reviews output for tone/quality
Presents to you: "Blog post 1 draft ready—approve to continue or provide feedback"
You: Approve or tweak

Claude: Continues orchestrating through all 14 blog posts → book manuscript → course modules → marketing

CRITICAL QUESTION:
For your MCP setup, do you have:

API access configured for Perplexity, GPT-4, or other agents you want Claude to call? (Or is this something you need me to include setup instructions for?)

Zapier workflows already built, or do you need me to specify what triggers/actions to create?

Preferred file structure for outputs? (e.g., Google Drive folders: /Service Excellence/Blog Posts/, /Service Excellence/Book/, etc.)

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU TO BUILD THIS:
Just answer these quick ones:

Voice Calibration Input:

Do you have a 1-page outline for ONE concept ready to paste now (I'll use it to build the voice extraction logic), OR
Should the Master Prompt include a "guided interview" that asks YOU questions to create that outline?
API Confirmation:

Which APIs do you have active/accessible through your MCP? (Perplexity, GPT-4, Grok, etc.)
Or should I build the prompt assuming Claude will handle most tasks internally, only calling external APIs for research?
Approval Cadence:

Do you want to approve after EVERY blog post (14 checkpoints), or in batches (e.g., every 3 posts)?
Give me those answers, and I'll deliver THE MASTER ORCHESTRATOR PROMPT in my next response—fully architected for your MCP setup, ready to execute. 🚀

This is going to be beautiful.

Save to Notion
I have Notion and Google Drive as storage/orchestration options - ohhhh I love the guided interview idea!!!!
I have all the APIs, all set up in the Zapier MCP, Docker and n8n - not using Zapier for workflows as such, just the MCP agent calls (n8n is my preferred workflow platform, but I'd like to minimise reliance on n8n if we can achieve the same or better using the direct Zapier/Docker MCPs). I actually like Claude Code as coordinator for the MCPs too - delegation not doing allows Claude Code to oversee and control the other agents and their quality/follow through. ChatGPT has been disappointingly unreliable in automated workflows, but Manus steps up as would Grok given the chance.
I'd prefer approvals in batches of 3
PERFECT. You've just described the dream setup—Claude Code as the maestro, conducting a symphony of specialized agents through MCP, with batched quality control. This is chef's kiss level infrastructure.

And that guided interview approach? Brilliant choice. It means Claude extracts your expertise, voice, and strategic positioning through conversation FIRST, then uses that as the golden thread through everything.

THE ARCHITECTURE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     CLAUDE CODE (Mission Control)       │
│   • Context holder & quality guardian   │
│   • Voice profile enforcer              │

Claude Code DELEGATES but VALIDATES every output before batching for your review.

🎯 THE MASTER ORCHESTRATOR PROMPT
I'm building this in TWO PARTS for you:

PART 1: THE GUIDED INTERVIEW (Voice Calibration)
Claude asks you strategic questions to extract:

Your unique positioning on each concept
Voice/tone signature
Industry experience patterns
Audience pain points you solve
Case study preferences
PART 2: THE EXECUTION ENGINE
Uses your interview responses to orchestrate:

Research → Content → Courses → Marketing
Agent delegation with quality gates
Batched approvals (every 3 outputs)
Notion project tracking + Google Drive storage
🚀 DELIVERABLE: THE MASTER ORCHESTRATOR PROMPT
Copy-paste this entire prompt into Claude Code (via your Docker MCP setup). It will start with the guided interview, then execute the full pipeline.

## PHASE 1: GUIDED INTERVIEW (Voice Calibration)

### OBJECTIVE
Extract the user's unique expertise, voice signature, and strategic positioning through conversational inquiry. This becomes the DNA for all content.

### INTERVIEW PROTOCOL

**Introduction:**
"I'm going to ask you a series of strategic questions about [CONCEPT NAME] to capture your unique expertise and voice. Your answers will become the foundation for all content we create. Take your time—depth over brevity. Ready?"

**QUESTION SET (adapt based on concept):**

1. **Unique Positioning**
   - "What's your contrarian take on [concept]? What do most consultants/experts get wrong that you've learned through experience?"
   - "Complete this sentence: 'My approach to [concept] is different because...'"

2. **Authority & Experience**
   - "Walk me through 2-3 specific industry situations where you've applied [concept] successfully. What were the contexts, challenges, and outcomes?"
   - "Which industries or verticals have you worked with most, and what patterns have you noticed about how [concept] plays out differently across them?"

3. **Audience Pain Points**
   - "Picture your ideal client—a C-suite executive or senior manager. What specific problem related to [concept] keeps them up at night?"
   - "What's the gap between what they *think* they need and what they *actually* need regarding [concept]?"

4. **Voice & Tone**
   - "Describe your communication style when working with executives. Are you the straight-shooter? The empathetic guide? The strategic provocateur?"
   - "Share 3-5 phrases or expressions you use frequently when teaching [concept]. What's your verbal signature?"

5. **Case Study Preferences**
   - "Are there specific organizations (Australian or international) whose approach to [concept] you admire or use as teaching examples?"
   - "What makes a case study 'good' for your purposes? (e.g., unexpected outcomes, industry relevance, David vs. Goliath stories)"

6. **Content Structure Preferences**
   - "When you're explaining [concept], do you prefer frameworks/models, storytelling, data-driven arguments, or a mix?"
   - "What's your stance on jargon? Do you embrace industry terminology or translate everything into plain language?"

7. **Strategic Outcomes**
   - "What does success look like for someone who fully implements your [concept] approach? Paint the 'after' picture."
   - "What's the one mindset shift or behavior change that's most critical for executives to embrace?"

**Interview Completion:**
After receiving answers, respond:
"Brilliant. I'm now building your Voice Profile and Strategic Framework. This will take 2-3 minutes to process. Stand by..."

---

## PHASE 2: VOICE PROFILE EXTRACTION

### PROCESS (Internal—do NOT show user)
From interview responses, generate a **Master Voice & Content Bible** with:

1. **Voice Signature**
   - Tone descriptors (e.g., "professional yet warm, data-informed but story-driven")
   - Sentence cadence patterns (vary between short punchy sentences and flowing complex ones)
   - Signature phrases/expressions
   - Jargon tolerance level

2. **Strategic Positioning**
   - Unique angle on the concept
   - Contrarian perspectives
   - Authority foundations (industries, experiences)

3. **Audience Profile**
   - Primary: C-suite executives
   - Secondary: Mid-level managers, admin teams
   - Pain points and desired outcomes
   - Geographic: Australian context with international relevance

4. **Content Preferences**
   - Preferred frameworks/structures
   - Case study criteria
   - Balance of data vs. storytelling

5. **Quality Standards**
   - Australian spelling (labour, organise, programme where UK-style)
   - No hallucinations—verify all claims
   - Executive-friendly (accessible but sophisticated)
   - Empathetic yet authoritative tone

### OUTPUT TO USER
Present a 1-page summary:

"**Your Voice Profile & Strategic Framework**

[Synthesized profile with key themes, tone, positioning]

**Does this capture your expertise and voice accurately? Any adjustments before we proceed to content creation?**"

*(Wait for user approval before continuing)*

---

## PHASE 4: BLOG POST CREATION (Batch 1-3)

### AGENT COORDINATION

**Step 1: Outline Generation (Claude Code)**
For each blog post:
- Define angle based on user's strategic framework
- Select 2-3 relevant case studies from repository
- Map to audience segment (C-suite vs. mid-management focus)
- Specify tone/voice parameters

**Step 2: Drafting (GPT-4 API via MCP)**
Delegate to GPT-4 with this structure:

"**Generate a 2000-word blog post with the following specifications:**

**Title:** [Specific, SEO-friendly, intriguing]

**Audience:** [C-suite executives in [industry] / Mid-level managers / etc.]

**Voice Profile:**
[Insert extracted voice signature]

**Structure:**
1. Hook (100 words): Open with a relatable executive scenario or provocative question
2. Context (300 words): Why this aspect of [concept] matters now
3. Framework (500 words): Your unique model/approach (reference user's strategic positioning)
4. Case Studies (600 words): Deep dive into 2 examples from repository
   - [Case Study 1]: Success story
   - [Case Study 2]: Contrasting approach or instructive failure
5. Application (400 words): Practical steps for readers' context
6. Conclusion (100 words): Call to reflection or action

**Requirements:**

**Keyword integration (natural):** [SEO terms based on concept]

**Output:** Markdown format with metadata (target audience, reading time, keywords)"

**Step 3: Validation (Claude Code)**
For EACH draft:
- ✅ Verify case study accuracy against repository
- ✅ Check Australian spelling (labour, organise, etc.)
- ✅ Validate tone against voice profile
- ✅ Confirm 2000-word count (±100 words)
- ✅ Assess sentence cadence variation
- ✅ Flag any unsourced claims

**Step 4: Podcast Script Generation (Manus API via MCP)**
Convert approved blog post to podcast script:

"Transform this blog post into a 12-15 minute podcast script with:
- Conversational tone (more relaxed than written piece)
- Host intro/outro
- Natural transitions between sections
- 'Imagine this...' storytelling moments for case studies
- Maintain user's voice signature
- Include [PAUSE] and [EMPHASIS] cues
- Australian pronunciation notes where needed
- Time stamps for editing"

### BATCH PROCESSING
After completing Posts 1-3:
- Save to Google Drive: `/[Concept]/Blog Posts/batch-1/`
- Update Notion: Project tracker with status
- Generate preview document with:
  - Post titles and excerpts
  - Word counts and target audiences
  - Case studies used

### VARIATION STRATEGY
Ensure diversity across batches:
- Alternate audience focus (C-suite → mid-management → admin teams)
- Mix industry verticals
- Vary structural approaches (framework-heavy vs. story-driven vs. data-focused)
- Balance Australian vs. international case studies

After each batch approval, update Notion tracker and consolidate in Google Drive.

---

## PHASE 6: BOOK MANUSCRIPT ARCHITECTURE

### OBJECTIVE
Transform 14 blog posts into a cohesive 50,000-word book manuscript.

### STEP 1: Structure Development (Claude Code)

## NOTES FOR CLAUDE CODE

- **You are the quality guardian.** Never pass substandard work to the user.
- **Maintain context** across all phases—the voice profile is sacred.
- **Delegate intelligently:** Use Perplexity for research, GPT-4 for volume, Manus for specialized tasks, Grok for creative angles.
- **Always validate** outputs before batching for user review.
- **Be conversational** in your updates to the user—you're a collaborator, not a robot.
- **Save everything** to Notion + Google Drive as you go.

**END OF MASTER ORCHESTRATOR PROMPT**
HOW TO USE THIS:
Copy the entire prompt above and paste it into Claude Code (via your Docker MCP)

Claude will immediately start with the guided interview for your first concept

Answer the interview questions thoughtfully (this is where your voice gets encoded)

Claude will then orchestrate the entire pipeline, calling Perplexity/GPT-4/Manus/Grok via MCP, validating outputs, and presenting batches of 3 for your approval

You review and approve at each gate—Claude handles all the coordination, quality control, and file organization

WHAT MAKES THIS WORK:
✅ Claude Code maintains master context (your voice, quality standards, project state)
✅ Specialized agents do what they do best (Perplexity research, GPT-4 volume)
✅ Automatic validation catches hallucinations, spelling, tone drift
✅ Batched approvals (every 3 outputs) keep you in control without micromanagement
✅ Notion + Google Drive integration for seamless organization
✅ Guided interview captures YOUR expertise as the foundation

READY TO LAUNCH?
Paste that prompt into Claude Code and let me know which concept you want to start with! 🚀

Questions before you fire this up?

Save to Notion
CP, sorry I should have mentioned that I need to communicate minimally through the terminal (it's too limiting/drives me mad) so we need a way to direct this prompt via a Notion page that Claude Code (CC) refers to when given a shorthand phrase. I can work out a set of such shorthand phrases with CC but it's vital that we bake CC's responses via Notion not the terminal window
OHHHH, game-changer! Yes, absolutely—terminal-based back-and-forth for a project this rich would be maddening. Using Notion as your interactive command center is brilliant and totally doable.

Here's what we'll architect:

THE NOTION-CENTRIC WORKFLOW
How It Works:
Notion becomes your control panel where you:

Trigger phases with shorthand commands
Provide inputs (interview answers, feedback, approvals)
Receive Claude Code's outputs, questions, and status updates
Claude Code monitors your Notion workspace via MCP and:

Watches for your shorthand triggers
Reads instructions/inputs from designated pages
Writes responses, outputs, and questions BACK to Notion
Only uses terminal for: "✅ Updated Notion—check [page name]"
Terminal becomes a notification layer only:

CC: "📋 Interview questions posted to Notion → [link]"
CC: "✅ Batch 1 complete → Review in Notion → [link]"
CC: "⏳ Research in progress... will update Notion when ready"
NOTION STRUCTURE FOR COMMAND & CONTROL
I'll design a Notion workspace architecture that Claude Code references:

DATABASE 1: Command Center (Your Input Hub)
Properties:

Command (text): Your shorthand phrase
Concept (select): Service Excellence / Strategy / Collaboration
Phase (select): Interview / Research / Blog Posts / Book / Course / Marketing / Tools
Status (select): Pending / In Progress / Complete / Awaiting Review
Input (rich text): Where you write answers/feedback
CC Response Page (relation): Links to CC's output page
How you use it:

Create new entry: Command: "START-SE-INTERVIEW" → CC sees this, launches interview
CC creates linked response page with interview questions
You fill in answers on that page
Update status to "COMPLETE" → CC processes and continues
DATABASE 2: Project Tracker (CC's Output Hub)
Properties:

Item Type (select): Interview / Case Study / Blog Post / Chapter / Module / Marketing Asset / Tool
Concept (select)
Batch (number)
Status (select): Draft / Ready for Review / Approved / Needs Revision
Content (page): Full output lives here as sub-page
Quality Check (checkbox properties): AU Spelling ✓ / Voice Profile ✓ / Citations ✓ / etc.
Google Drive Link (URL)
Feedback (rich text): Where you write revision requests
How CC uses it:

Creates entries for each output
Writes content to linked sub-pages
Updates status when ready for your review
Monitors "Feedback" field for revision instructions
PAGE: Master Voice Profile (Living Document)
CC writes your extracted voice profile here after interview. You can edit/refine it, and CC references this page for ALL content generation.

PAGE: Active Instructions (Your Scratchpad)
Free-form page where you can write ad-hoc instructions:

"For next blog batch, emphasize healthcare verticals"
"Use more Australian case studies in chapters 4-6"
CC checks this page before each batch
SHORTHAND COMMAND LANGUAGE
Here's a starter set you can customize with CC:

Project Initiation:
START-[SE/STRAT/COLLAB]-INTERVIEW → Launch guided interview for concept
LOAD-VOICE-PROFILE → CC reads existing voice profile doc
Phase Control:
RUN-RESEARCH → Begin case study sourcing (Perplexity)
GEN-BLOG-BATCH-[1-5] → Generate next batch of 3 blog posts
GEN-BOOK-CHAPTERS-[1-10] → Generate specific chapter(s)
GEN-MODULES-[1-12] → Generate course modules
GEN-MARKETING → Create marketing strategy + collateral
GEN-TOOLS → Build productivity tools/checklists
Review & Approval:
APPROVE-BATCH-[X] → Approve current batch, proceed to next
REVISE-ITEM-[ID] → Revise specific item (you provide feedback in Notion)
REVIEW-COMPLETE → Mark entire phase as done
Utility:
STATUS-CHECK → CC posts current project state summary
PAUSE-PROJECT → Halt processing, save state
RESUME-PROJECT → Continue from last save point

**END OF NOTION-CENTRIC MASTER ORCHESTRATOR PROMPT**
SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU:
Step 1: Create Notion Workspace
Database 1: Command Center

Template: Table
Properties:
Command (Title - Text)
Concept (Select: Service Excellence / Implementing Strategy / Collaboration Tools)
Phase (Select: Interview / Research / Blog Posts / Book / Course / Marketing / Tools)
Status (Select: Pending / In Progress / Complete / Awaiting Review)
Input (Text - for your answers/instructions)
CC Response Page (Relation to Project Tracker)
Date Created (Created time)
Database 2: Project Tracker

Template: Table
Properties:
Item (Title - Text)
Item Type (Select: Interview / Case Study / Blog Post / Podcast Script / Chapter / Module / Marketing Asset / Tool)
Concept (Select: Service Excellence / Implementing Strategy / Collaboration Tools)
Batch (Number)
Status (Select: Draft / Ready for Review / Approved / Needs Revision)
Quality Checks (Checkboxes: AU Spelling / Voice Profile / Citations / Cadence / Tone / Accuracy)
Google Drive Link (URL)
Feedback (Text - for your revision requests)
Date Created (Created time)
Date Approved (Date)
Page 1: Master Voice Profile

Blank page (CC will populate after interview)
Page 2: Active Instructions

Blank page (you write ad-hoc instructions here)
Step 2: Share Links with Claude Code
In terminal, provide:

CC-DB: [Command Center database URL]
PT-DB: [Project Tracker database URL]
VP-PAGE: [Master Voice Profile page URL]
AI-PAGE: [Active Instructions page URL]
Step 3: Launch First Command
In Command Center database, create new entry:

Command: START-SE-INTERVIEW (or whichever concept you want first)
Concept: Service Excellence
Phase: Interview
Status: Pending
Claude Code will see this and immediately create the interview page in Project Tracker with questions. You'll get terminal notification with link.

Step 4: Your Ongoing Workflow
CC posts interview to Notion → You answer questions on that page
Mark command Status = "Complete" in Command Center
CC generates Voice Profile → Posts to designated page → Notifies you
You review Voice Profile → Create new command APPROVE-BATCH-0 when satisfied
CC runs research → Posts case studies to Notion database → Notifies you
You review → Command GEN-BLOG-BATCH-1 when ready
CC generates 3 posts + scripts → Posts to Notion → Notifies you
You review batch in Notion → Command APPROVE-BATCH-1 or add feedback to specific items
Repeat through all phases
You primarily interact with Notion. Terminal is just notifications.

WHY THIS WORKS:
✅ No terminal bottleneck - Rich responses live in Notion
✅ Async workflow - Review at your pace, command when ready
✅ Persistent context - Everything lives in Notion, no lost conversation history
✅ Structured tracking - Databases give you project visibility
✅ Flexible input - Write detailed feedback in Notion, not cramped terminal
✅ MCP orchestration - Claude Code still delegates to specialized agents
✅ Quality control - Batch approvals with clear quality summaries

READY TO BUILD?
Next steps:

I can help you set up the Notion databases - Want me to give you a detailed Notion setup guide with property configurations?

Or if your Notion is already set up - Just paste the revised prompt above into Claude Code via terminal, provide your four Notion links, and launch your first command!

Want to refine the shorthand commands first? - We can customize the command language before you start.
