# Strategic Planning Session: Redefining RWAV's Role in Building Healthy Rural Communities

## Executive Summary

This strategic planning session, facilitated by consultant **Carla**, engaged the board in a foundational discussion about the future direction of the organization (RWAV). The central theme was a proposed paradigm shift from being a traditional "health workforce" agency to becoming a holistic facilitator for "building good communities." Key concepts explored included adopting a public health lens focused on the socio-economic determinants of health, leveraging RWAV's unique position as a neutral and "trusted friend" to government and communities, and championing systems-level advocacy on issues like digital infrastructure. The board discussed moving towards community-led solutions, piloting innovative models with academic partners to generate evidence, and diversifying revenue streams by engaging the private sector. The meeting concluded with an agreement for Carla to hold individual follow-up sessions with board members to further develop these strategic concepts.

## Redefining Organizational Identity & Purpose

The board engaged in a significant discussion about the core identity and mission of the organization.

• **Shift from Workforce to Community Building**: **Roger** posed a transformative idea, stating, "I'm not actually sure we're in the health workforce business anymore... we're actually in the business of helping to build good societies." This reflects a move beyond simply placing health professionals ("putting backsides on seats") to focusing on the overall well-being and benefit of the community.

• **Socio-Economic Determinants of Health**: **Louise** suggested framing this broader vision through the public health lens of "socio-economic determinants of health." This allows RWAV to stay within its health-focused brand while strategically addressing interconnected issues like housing, education, transport, and access to healthy food, which are all critical for a thriving community and a stable health workforce.

• **Maintaining Core Identity**: While embracing a broader vision, members like **Matt** and **Jane** emphasized the importance of not losing the current identity, which provides the organization with its initial voice and credibility. The consensus was to build upon the existing foundation, not abandon it.

## Key Strategic Shifts Discussed

The conversation highlighted several key shifts in approach needed to realize this new vision.

• **Community-Led Solutions**: There was strong agreement on moving away from a top-down, "patriarchal" approach. The future strategy should focus on empowering local communities and First Nations partners to design and drive their own workforce solutions. This includes having honest, "tough love" conversations with communities about the sustainability of old service models.

• **Systems-Level Advocacy**: The group recognized the need for an enhanced advocacy role. Rather than just working within the current system, RWAV should advocate for changes to the systemic barriers (e.g., poor internet connectivity) that inhibit the attraction and retention of all professionals in rural areas. This would be done in collaboration with other invested organizations.

• **Role as a Neutral Facilitator**: RWAV's unique position as a neutral, apolitical entity was identified as a major strength. **Matt** suggested leveraging access to federal, state, and local governments to act as a facilitator, connecting various community stakeholders to address broad issues. **Jane** noted that being a neutral connector who understands the entire system is a key point of difference.

## Innovation and Future Models

The board explored how to move beyond incremental improvements and foster genuine innovation.

• **The "Leapfrog" Opportunity**: **Carla** challenged the board to consider what it would take for rural Victoria to "skip a generation of progress" and become an innovative health workforce hub.

• **Piloting New Approaches**: A key actionable idea, proposed by **Grant**, is for RWAV to work with government to secure funding to pilot new models in different towns. These pilots should be conducted in partnership with universities to ensure academic rigor and generate the evidence needed to prove what works.

• **Facilitating Community-Designed Pilots**: **Matt** built on this by suggesting RWAV's role could be to facilitate sessions where communities design their own solutions, which could then be presented to government as pilot programs. Success would be redefined not just by implementation, but by the act of bringing communities together to create a new model.

## Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships

The discussion emphasized the importance of deepening and broadening relationships.

• **The "Trusted Friend"**: **Roger** highlighted that governments are looking for "trusted friends" who can help implement policy without a self-serving agenda. RWAV's non-profit status and focus on community benefit make it an ideal candidate for this role.

• **Reputation and Trust**: The organization's long-standing reputation and trustworthiness are foundational. This trust enables the collection of high-quality data and gives RWAV credibility at the table with all stakeholders.

• **Engaging the Private Sector**: A significant theme was the need to build partnerships with the private sector in rural and regional areas. These businesses are also dependent on healthy communities and could become key partners in funding and supporting pilot programs and other initiatives.

## Data as a Strategic Asset

Data was consistently identified as a cornerstone of the future strategy.

• **A Trusted Source of Information**: **Jane** articulated the vision for RWAV to be the primary "trusted source of information about community health across Victoria."

• **Enabling Advocacy and Trust**: High-quality data, which RWAV is uniquely positioned to collect due to its reputation, is essential for building evidence-based advocacy arguments and reinforcing its trusted status.

• **Strategic Value over Commercialization**: The board discussed that while data is a highly valuable asset, the strategy is not to sell it. Instead, it should be used to facilitate partnerships, prove the case for investment, and strengthen the organization's overall strategic position.

## Financial Sustainability & Funding Diversification

**Carla's** question about the disappearance of core funding sparked a critical discussion on long-term financial health.

• **Moving Beyond Government Reliance**: The board acknowledged the reality that government funding is unlikely to increase, making financial diversification essential for survival and growth.

• **Tapping into Private Sector Resources**: The primary strategy identified was to engage the private sector. The value proposition would be that investing in RWAV is an investment in building the healthy, stable communities that their businesses rely on. This was seen as a 5-10 year journey to build the necessary track record.

• **Commissioning vs. Owning**: **Roger** posed a key strategic question about whether RWAV should run pilots directly or act as a commissioner that funds and evaluates pilots, scaling up the successful ones.

## Next Steps

• **Individual Director Consultations**: **Carla** will conduct one-on-one meetings with board members to further explore the strategic ideas discussed.

• **Scheduling**: **Kate** will coordinate the scheduling of these individual meetings between directors and **Carla**.

• **Ongoing Ideation**: **Carla** encouraged all board members to continue developing these ideas and to reach out to her directly as they refine their thoughts on partnerships, solutions, and future possibilities.

• **Strategy Development**: The insights from the board will be combined with feedback from the internal RWAV team to begin formulating realistic strategies and identifying key community partners.
