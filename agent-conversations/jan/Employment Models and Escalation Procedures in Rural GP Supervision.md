Hi Jan it's Jan with an a hi Jan I need your help please to develop the content for a presentation that needs to go for about 60 minutes the topic is employment models in general practice supervision and escalation procedures so I've attached for you the latest version of the national terms and conditions for employing registrars that's been coordinated by myself as behalf of GPS and this NTC as it's referred to this industrial instrument provides the framework which is non-mandatory for general practices who employ and train GP registrars who will turn into rural generalists and they are the end point in discussion at the summit that I will presenting this out so rural general so geez they our target of this discussion our audience are supervisors and practice owners who need to know their rights but also their obligations and how things are changing in this employment sphere so the version of the NCR that I've given you includes three new well it's more than three so it includes new schedules schedule a has always been a part of it the document has always been the purpose of this document has always been to basically bring together the national employment standards or NES that sits under the legal framework of the fair work act 2009 here in Australia along with the context of this apprenticeship model of general practice training under the Australian general practice training program or the AGPT program now AGT is only one pathway and the Akram or ACCARM Akram is how that's pronounced the Akram model of training is for rural generalist specifically now they are different to the urban general practitioners they are more involved in working between the private health setting of general practice and public health delivery within small rural hospitals and in remote settings so the NTC has largely been focused on those urban GPs in that setting in that legal context what we've tried to do in bringing in the new schedules is acknowledge where those best practice principles of employment and training can overlap between the NTC and these non-AGPT pathways now the ones that are really important for this presentation for the acre audience are the RGTS or rural generalist training scheme and the IP or independent pathway they are Akrams principal non-AGpT pathways however as of the start of 2020 6RGTS is coming under the under the AGPT basically it's been merged into it so anybody who currently employs a trainee under the RGTS pathway they kind of had to abide by the NTC but now they also get all the benefits of being party to the AGP T under the NTC so the RGTS is a pathway of the Akram fellowship it ceases as such on 31 December 2020 5RGTS registrars will be transition to a GPT from 1 January 2026 the NTC provide some some guidance around how to work with this but really what we're trying to do we're not employment specialists as independent peaks we are independent peaks supervision so we direct people back to get their own independent legal and accounting advice to make sure that they are safe in their employment set up but the guidance that we provide does show how the RTS is impacted practices with RGTS employment they're basically needing to wait for department advice because there are a few of those who might be employing people as contractors now that contracting arrangement it's not in line with the Commonwealth expectations of what's acceptable potentially for an employment model with with Commonwealth funding attached to it that's why now the RGTS will have access to that Commonwealth funding there will be a change needed for those people who have relied upon the flexibility of having trainee work within their practice just under a contract and it's all very independent of any other legal or employment framework that has changed but not not as a GPS thing not even as a funding thing under the AGPT it has changed because the fair work ombudsman has now in the last eight months chosen to use the same sort of definition of contractor versus employee that the ATO has been using for sometime now so for their own protection anybody who has a staff member who is currently on a contract needs to be wise to what that might mean long-term to the safety of the perpetuating that arrangement now the other points are with the RTS coming under the AGPT flexible funds will be within the grass of both practices and registrars so practices will be able to apply for flexible funds to provide funded additional support if they are identified as having difficulty with those registrars so will stay the same for this RTS arrangement training post and supervisor accreditation process no change registrar placement process no change registrar education and training requirements no change registrar assessment requirements no change registrar support to training posts supervisors and registrars or regional regional support to training post supervisors and registrars no change. Please refer to the content within the NTC for information about escalation processes for dispute resolution purposes and also search the Internet for information about how different medical awards particularly those in Queensland public health deal with things like dispute resolution and what's it called management processes and how to actually make that work within the context of general practice where there is the intersection with public health so please draft me a 20 slide presentation will start with with 20 slides if you can start building up the information to present on these things I will be presenting alongside somebody who will talk to the single employer model as a different type of employment model so my focus will really have to be on how the NTC build in protections for both parties and has been devised as a means to to offer the same sort of protections as the hospital awards without all the rigmarole so I'm leaving it to you Jan
I'll help you develop this presentation on employment models in general practice supervision and escalation procedures. Let me start by examining the NTC document you've provided and then research additional information about medical awards and dispute resolution processes.

<p class="font-medium">What is the legal status of the NTCER in relation to the Fair Work Act?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">The NTCER is a non-mandatory industrial instrument that operates within the framework of the Fair Work Act 2009. While not legally binding in the same way as an Award, it provides a framework that meets or exceeds the National Employment Standards (NES). Practices that follow the NTCER can be confident they're complying with the Fair Work Act's minimum requirements, while addressing the specific context of GP training.</p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- FAQ Item 2 -->
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this.nextElementSibling)">
<p class="font-medium">Are practices legally required to implement the NTCER?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">No, the NTCER is not mandatory. However, practices that employ GP registrars under the AGPT program are strongly encouraged to adopt it, as it has become the industry standard. From 2026, when RGTS transitions to AGPT, practices will need to comply with Commonwealth funding requirements, which generally align with NTCER provisions. The Fair Work Act's minimum standards must be met regardless of whether you adopt the NTCER.</p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- FAQ Item 3 -->
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this.nextElementSibling)">
<p class="font-medium">What are the key legal protections for registrars under the NTCER?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">The NTCER provides registrars with protections including: defined base and percentage payments, specified leave entitlements (annual, personal, study, exam), termination notice periods, protections against unfair dismissal, structured dispute resolution processes, and provisions for education release time. These align with Fair Work protections but are contextualized for the GP training environment.</p>
</div>

<!-- FAQ Item 4 -->
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this.nextElementSibling)">
<p class="font-medium">How does the contractor vs. employee distinction affect NTCER implementation?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">Recent Fair Work Ombudsman alignment with ATO definitions means many registrars previously engaged as contractors may actually be employees under law. The NTCER is designed for employment relationships, not contracting arrangements. Practices using contractor models may face legal risks including back-payment of entitlements, superannuation, and penalties. Commonwealth funding generally requires employment rather than contracting arrangements for GP training.</p>

</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">Practices should: 1) Review current arrangements with legal/accounting advice, 2) Develop a transition plan with timeline, 3) Communicate transparently with registrars about changes, 4) Implement new employment contracts based on NTCER, 5) Update payroll systems to accommodate leave entitlements and superannuation, and 6) Document the transition process.

<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">Required documentation includes: 1) NTCER-compliant employment contracts, 2) Updated practice policies incorporating dispute resolution procedures, 3) Leave accrual and management systems, 4) Education release documentation, 5) Base rate and percentage payment calculations, 6) Supervision agreements, and 7) Performance review templates.

<p class="text-gray-700">Practical steps include: 1) Review existing policies against NTCER requirements, 2) Develop or update dispute resolution procedures with clear escalation pathways, 3) Create templates for documenting concerns and interventions, 4) Establish timelines for each escalation stage, 5) Clearly define roles and responsibilities in the process, 6) Conduct staff training on updated policies, and 7) Schedule regular policy reviews.

<p class="font-medium">How do practices calculate and implement the NTCER's payment structure?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">The NTCER uses a base salary plus percentage structure. Practices should: 1) Determine the appropriate base salary level according to registrar experience, 2) Establish clear methods for calculating percentage payments (typically 49% of billing after reaching threshold), 3) Document billing thresholds, 4) Set up regular reconciliation periods (usually quarterly), 5) Maintain transparent billing records, and 6) Clearly explain calculations to registrars. GPSA provides spreadsheet templates to help with these calculations.</p>

<p class="font-medium">What is the recommended first step in resolving workplace disputes?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">The recommended first step is direct discussion between the registrar and immediate supervisor. This should be: 1) Timely—ideally within 24-48 hours of an issue arising, 2) Documented—key points and outcomes noted, 3) Private—conducted in a confidential setting, 4) Solution-focused—aimed at resolution rather than blame, and 5) Followed up—with agreed actions and timeline. Most issues can be resolved at this stage without further escalation.</p>

<p class="font-medium">When should a dispute be escalated beyond the practice level?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">Escalation beyond practice level is appropriate when: 1) Internal processes have been exhausted without resolution, 2) The issue involves serious misconduct or patient safety concerns, 3) There is a significant conflict of interest within the practice, 4) The dispute involves interpretation of the NTCER provisions, or 5) The timeframe for resolution at practice level (typically 14 days) has elapsed without progress. Documentation of previous attempts at resolution is essential before external escalation.</p>

<p class="font-medium">What timeframes should practices adhere to in the escalation process?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">Key timeframes include: 1) Initial discussion—within 48 hours of issue identification, 2) Practice-level resolution—attempt within 14 days, 3) Senior management/committee response—within 7 days of escalation, 4) External mediator involvement—initiated within 14 days of failed internal resolution, 5) Fair Work Commission referral—if no resolution within 30 days of initial complaint. These timeframes should be documented in practice policies, with flexibility for complex issues.</p>

<p class="font-medium">How does the Fair Work Commission process work for GP training disputes?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">The FWC process typically involves: 1) Application submission with evidence of prior resolution attempts, 2) Initial conference (usually within 21 days) to explore conciliation options, 3) Mediation/conciliation with appointed FWC member, 4) Formal arbitration if agreed by both parties (resulting in binding decision), 5) Continued workplace operation during the process unless safety issues exist. Either party may appoint a representative, and proceedings are generally less formal than court hearings.</p>

<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">Existing RGTS contracts will need review and potential amendment as RGTS ceases on December 31, 2025. Practices should: 1) Assess current arrangements against AGPT/NTCER requirements, 2) Identify gaps or non-compliant elements, 3) Draft new agreements or amendments effective January 1, 2026, 4) Ensure all accrued entitlements transfer to new arrangements per Schedule 4, 5) Have transitional agreements legally reviewed, and 6) Execute new contracts with clear communication about changes.</p>

<p class="font-medium">What constitutes an emergency escalation situation?</p>
<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">Emergency escalation is warranted when: 1) Patient safety is at immediate risk, 2) There is evidence of serious clinical misconduct, 3) A registrar is practicing while impaired (substance abuse, severe mental health crisis), 4) There are serious breaches of professional boundaries, or 5) Criminal activity is suspected. These situations bypass normal escalation timeframes and require immediate supervisor intervention, documentation, and potentially notification to external authorities.</p>

</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">For urgent patient safety concerns: 1) Immediate supervisor intervention is required, 2) Patients should be transferred to other clinicians as needed, 3) Document the concern specifically and objectively, 4) Implement appropriate supervision restrictions, 5) Notify the Medical Education Officer/Regional Training Organization within 24 hours, 6) Consider mandatory reporting obligations to AHPRA if threshold is met, and 7) Develop remediation plan with clear timelines and supervision requirements.</p>

<i class="fas fa-plus medical-blue text-sm"></i>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p class="text-gray-700">External notification is required when: 1) The concern meets AHPRA mandatory reporting thresholds (practicing while intoxicated, sexual misconduct, significant departure from standards risking harm), 2) Criminal activity is suspected (contact police), 3) There is risk of harm to the registrar or others (mental health crisis), 4) The practice cannot provide sufficient supervision to ensure safety, or 5) Repeated serious concerns have not improved with remediation. Always document your decision-making process regarding external notification.</p>
