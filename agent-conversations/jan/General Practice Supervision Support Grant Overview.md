GPTA Ltd General Practice Supervision Support Grant Requirements and Strategic Framework

Executive Summary

GPTA Ltd trading as General Practice Supervision Australia (GPSA) is the designated recipient for Activity 2: General Practice Supervision Support under the General Practice Training Support Activities grant opportunity. As the peak national representative body for GP supervisors, GPTA Ltd will receive $4.902 million over six financial years (2025-26 to 2030-31) to deliver comprehensive support services that enhance vocational training for general practitioners and rural generalists across Australia.

Core Objectives and Performance Expectations

GPTA Ltd must deliver five interconnected objectives that align with the Australian General Practice Training Program goals and broader health workforce reforms:

Objective 1: Industrial and Workplace Relations Support GPTA Ltd must lead the review and negotiation of the National Terms and Conditions for the Employment of Registrars, providing comprehensive advice, communication, consultation and engagement to GP and RG supervisors and practices. This includes maintaining transparent feedback mechanisms and ensuring supervisor interests are effectively represented in all industrial relations matters affecting the training environment.

Objective 2: Promotion and Participation Enhancement The organisation must implement targeted strategies to maintain and encourage increased participation of practices and supervisors in general practice and rural generalism training, with particular focus on regional, rural, remote and other high-need locations. This involves administering peer networks, conducting outreach activities, and developing compelling promotional materials that highlight the value and impact of supervision roles.

Objective 3: Professional Support Services Delivery GPTA Ltd must provide accessible, relevant professional support services specifically designed for GP and RG supervisors. This includes developing educational resources, facilitating professional development opportunities, providing direct support channels, and ensuring supervisors have the tools and knowledge necessary to effectively mentor trainees across all Commonwealth-funded GP training programs.

Objective 4: Representation and Advocacy The organisation must represent and advocate for GP and RG supervisors and practices through developing and maintaining collaborative relationships with key stakeholders including GP Colleges, government bodies, and training organisations. This requires establishing robust feedback mechanisms, transparently communicating supervisor concerns, and working proactively with stakeholders to reduce survey fatigue while maximising sector input.

Objective 5: Cultural Safety Enhancement GPTA Ltd must work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stakeholders to enhance the cultural responsiveness of the GP and RG workforce in training settings. This involves developing culturally appropriate resources, facilitating cultural competency training, and ensuring training environments provide culturally safe experiences for both supervisors and registrars.

Collaboration Opportunities with GPRA

This coordination would strengthen collective bargaining power and ensure comprehensive representation of both supervisor and registrar perspectives in workplace relations matters.

Coordinated Career Promotion Campaigns: Develop joint promotional initiatives targeting medical students, junior doctors, and current practitioners to encourage entry into general practice and rural generalism. Co-hosted events and shared promotional materials would present cohesive career pathways while maximising reach and impact of promotional efforts.

This approach would enhance resource efficiency while fostering shared understanding of roles and expectations.

Joint training programs, shared resource development, and coordinated engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stakeholders would ensure consistent messaging and improved outcomes for Indigenous communities seeking culturally appropriate care.
