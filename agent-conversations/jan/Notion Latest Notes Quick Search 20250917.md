The Meeting Memos page shows it's organised into categories (CARLORBIZ, GPSA/HPSA, ACRRM, Personal) but I can see it contains child pages. Since this was last edited on 9th September 2025 at 07:04, this could contain the meeting you're referring to. However, the specific transcript isn't visible in the main page content.

Could you clarify which category the Tuesday 9th September meeting falls under? Was it:

CARLORBIZ (your consulting business)
GPSA/HPSA (your work with General Practice Supervision Australia)
ACRRM (Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine)
Personal
This will help me locate the exact meeting memo and transcript you need. Alternatively, if you recall any specific keywords or attendees from the meeting, I could search for those terms to narrow it down further.
