jan i need you to access all of my meeting memos from the Meeting Memos db in Notion and compile all meeting summaries referring to RWAV/the RWAV (incorrectly referred to as "R-WAVE" in many instances) strategic plan. I need these structured as a single document we can continue to add to, ie with the meeting minutes created by Genspark AI meeting Notes and also this please: INTRODUCTION

Overview of Conversation  
This transcript captures a discussion between Carla and Kathryn, focusing on rural and remote allied health workforce challenges, organizational collaboration, funding, advocacy, and community-driven solutions. The conversation also touches on personal experiences and concludes with a lighthearted exchange about their dogs.

---

SECTION 1: OPENING AND CONTEXT

Initial Greetings and Setting  
- Carla joins the meeting from her car due to weather and scheduling constraints.  
- Kathryn is in Canberra, enjoying unseasonably warm weather.  
- The conversation begins informally, establishing rapport.

Purpose of the Meeting  
- Carla seeks to understand Kathryn’s role and how it interfaces with ARHWave, aiming to clarify organizational relationships and objectives.

---

SECTION 2: ORGANIZATIONAL ROLES AND TOUCHPOINTS

Kathryn’s Role and Organization  
- Kathryn is CEO of Services for Australian Rural and Remote Allied Health (SARRAH), a national peak body representing allied health professionals in rural and remote Australia.  
- SARRAH focuses on access and equity issues for these communities.

Key Areas of Activity  
1. Workforce Development Programs  
   - SARRAH leads initiatives like the Allied Health Rural Generalist Pathway, promoting rural generalist training for 10 allied health professions.
   - This work is more complex than medical generalist training due to multiple clinical councils involved.

2. Funding and Program Implementation  
   - SARRAH has implemented a national program to grow rural generalists, but government funding was discontinued last year.
   - The organization is now seeking alternative funding through rural workforce agencies and PHNs.

3. Engagement with ARHWave  
   - Kathryn has participated in the Allied Health Advisory Committee and outreach program reviews with ARHWave, maintaining ongoing interest and involvement.

---

SECTION 3: STRATEGIC CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

ARHWave’s Strategic Direction  
- ARHWave’s board is passionate about long-term, impactful change, moving beyond piecemeal, short-term government-funded projects.
- The organization aims to collaborate with others to maximize social impact and support communities proactively, not just reactively.

Carla’s Perspective and Experience  
- Carla, former CEO of GPSA, expresses frustration with organizations protecting their own interests at the expense of community outcomes.
- She values independence and the ability to go beyond minimal grant requirements to achieve meaningful change.

Collaboration and Community Empowerment  
- Both speakers emphasize the need for organizations to work together, share data, and support communities in identifying and addressing their own needs.
- There is a desire to move from a “bums on seats” approach to building a retained, supported workforce and developing “grow-your-own” pathways for both GPs and allied health professionals.

---

SECTION 4: SYSTEMIC BARRIERS AND ADVOCACY

Barriers to Effective Workforce Development  
- Systemic issues include restrictive funding guidelines, lack of support for non-clinical training components, and inconsistent application of policies across states.
- Artificial barriers, such as Medicare provider number constraints, limit innovation and responsiveness to community needs.

Advocacy and System-Level Change  
- Both agree that organizations can and should advocate for changes to funding guidelines and system settings.
- There is a need to recognize the broader roles of allied health professionals, including their work in NDIS and aged care, not just primary care.

Impact of Policy and Funding Decisions  
- Recent changes, such as NDIS pricing, disproportionately affect rural and remote communities.
- Bundled funding streams are essential for sustaining outreach services; removing one can destabilize the entire system.

---

SECTION 5: COMMUNITY-LED INITIATIVES AND CAPACITY BUILDING

Community-Driven Solutions  
- Examples like the C4 Committees in Echuca and Moama demonstrate the power of community-led, self-funded initiatives to address workforce and service needs.
- When communities invest in solutions, issues like accommodation and childcare are more easily resolved.

Capacity Constraints in Allied Health  
- Allied health practices are often at capacity, with little time or resources to engage in additional initiatives or apply for grants.
- Unlike general practice, allied health receives less government subsidy for training and supervision, creating further challenges.

Opportunities for Innovation  
- There is potential for fund holders to step outside government guidelines and support workplace training grants and other capacity-building measures.
- Community engagement and collaboration with PHNs can help build sustainable solutions.

---

SECTION 6: DATA UTILIZATION AND COLLABORATIVE POTENTIAL

Unlocking the Value of Data  
- ARHWave possesses valuable data that could inform advocacy and policy at state and federal levels.
- Kathryn offers to collaborate on analyzing and presenting this data more effectively to highlight key workforce issues.

Expanding Collaboration  
- Both see value in stepping beyond traditional funding models to partner on community-led initiatives and workforce development.
- SARRAH can contribute expertise in allied health workforce delivery, development, and advocacy.

---

SECTION 7: PERSONAL CONNECTION AND CLOSING

Personal Exchange  
- The conversation ends with a friendly discussion about their dogs, sharing anecdotes and lightening the tone.

Next Steps  
- Carla plans to relay the discussion to ARHWave’s board and integrate insights into strategic planning.
- Both express willingness to continue collaborating and exploring new approaches.

---

CONCLUSION

Summary of Key Themes  
- The conversation highlights the importance of collaboration, advocacy, and community-driven solutions in addressing rural and remote allied health workforce challenges.
- Systemic barriers and funding constraints require innovative, cross-sector approaches.
- Effective use of data and shared expertise can drive meaningful change.
- Ongoing dialogue and partnership are essential for sustained impact.

Deep Research
Did you capture all of the awave uh or all of the files basically that sit under the nested list for uh Carlo Biz in the meeting memo database. All of those would be our wave. Did you capture all of those?
Let me check more thoroughly by examining all the RWAV files nested under CARLORBIZ in your Meeting Memos database. I can see from the main database that there were these specific meeting entries:

RWAV 20250819 - kick-off for Strategic Planning project
RWAV 20250822 - Board kickoff meeting
RWAV 25/08/2025 - Chair 1-on-1

You're absolutely right to question this, Carla. Looking at the search results, I can see that my original compilation may have missed some of the individual 1-on-1 meetings that were listed in your Meeting Memos database.

The specific meetings I can see from your nested list that I should capture include:

RWAV 20250819 - kick-off for Strategic Planning project
RWAV 20250822 - Board kickoff meeting
RWAV 25/08/2025 - Chair 1-on-1
RWAV 26/08/2025 - CEO 1-on-1
RWAV 26/08/2025 - Weekly round-up
RWAV 28/08/2025 - Team kickoff meeting
RWAV 30/08/2025 - Jane 1-on-1
RWAV 01/09/2025 - Roger 1-on-1
From my searches, I found some of the main strategic planning sessions, but I appears I haven't captured all of the individual 1-on-1 meetings and some of the specific dated meetings.

Let me search more specifically for these missing individual meetings. It's possible they exist as separate Notion pages that weren't picked up in my initial searches due to different naming conventions or they might be embedded within the larger strategic planning documents.

Would you like me to do a more comprehensive search to locate these specific individual meetings, or do you know if these individual 1-on-1 meetings exist as separate pages in your Notion? If they're there, I should definitely include them in the compilation to ensure we have the complete picture of your RWAV strategic planning process.

Deep Research
Yes, by my Reckoning. There are about 15 meetings just in notion. Um so you've got the the 7 or 8 that were nested but then underneath that car or B is heading. Before it reaches the next um toggle heading there are more that refer to The rural Workforce or rural planning or rural Health Care, they are all to be attributed to our wave as well. So it's basically All of the top part of that page on that memo, um, meeting memos page is um, rural Workforce agency, in some way, shape, or form. That needs to be captured here. They're 15 of those. Plus, the 1, I gave you plus what you had in your Jen spark, AI meeting notes. Thanks Jen,
You're absolutely right, Carla. I need to be more thorough and capture ALL the RWAV-related content from the top section of your Meeting Memos page. Let me do a comprehensive search to find all 15+ meetings that should be included.
