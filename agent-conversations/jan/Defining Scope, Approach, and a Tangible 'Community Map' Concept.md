## Executive Summary

This strategic meeting focused on defining the scope and approach for a new 'Healthy Communities' initiative. The discussion evolved from broad, conceptual ideas about co-design and community partnerships to a concrete, actionable proposal. The key outcome was the decision to pursue the development of a comprehensive 'Community Map'. This tool will layer workforce data with broader health and social determinants, positioning the organization as a central data profiler and connector. The group agreed on an iterative, pilot-based approach that allows for learning and adaptation, emphasizing the need to produce tangible outputs in the short term while building towards a long-term, sustainable model.

## Strategic Direction

The core strategic direction shifted towards leveraging the organization's primary strength in **workforce analysis** while addressing the broader context of community health. Instead of attempting to solve all community problems, the organization will focus on **profiling communities** to create a complete, evidence-based picture of their needs. This 'map' will serve as a foundational tool to engage government and private sector stakeholders in collaborative problem-solving. The agreed-upon strategy is to **lead with data and insights**, providing the evidence needed for targeted interventions by various partners.

## Key Discussion Points

### Co-Design vs. Iterative Action

- There was a significant discussion on the implementation approach. While all agreed on the necessity of **co-designing with communities**, a strong point was made to avoid getting stuck in prolonged planning.
- The consensus favored an **iterative, pilot-based methodology**: start doing, learn on the run, fail quickly, and adapt. This approach is seen as crucial for demonstrating progress and achieving short-term wins within a larger, longitudinal study.

### Defining the Research Question

- A central challenge identified was the nebulous nature of the initial project goals. The group grappled with defining what a 'healthy community' is and whether the focus should be on **access to care** or **health outcomes**.
- It was noted that government departments are using 'outcomes' language, but their funding models often still focus on 'outputs' or activity-based funding. The project could help create a template for determining desired community-specific outcomes.

### The Organization's Role: Profiler and Connector

- The discussion clarified the organization's role within the initiative. It was determined that the organization should not be the sole problem-solver but rather the entity that **creates a comprehensive profile of a community's needs**.
- This involves mapping the workforce, health profile, education, housing, and other factors to provide an evidence base for collaborative action.

### Workforce Mix and Future Models

- A major focus was on the future of the healthcare workforce. Key topics included:
  - The return to **generalism** to counter over-specialization.
  - Determining the **optimal workforce mix** for different communities (e.g., GPs, nurse practitioners, specialists).
  - The importance of professionals working to their **full scope of practice**.
  - The need for future-focused models that push boundaries beyond current constraints.

## Key Outcomes

- The primary outcome of the meeting was the conceptualization and agreement to pursue the **'Community Map' project**.
- This project is seen as a tangible, powerful, and achievable first step for the 'Healthy Communities' initiative.
- It provides a clear focus for the organization's efforts: data aggregation, visualization, and analysis to create an evidence-based profile of community needs.
- The map will serve as a platform to engage partners and drive targeted sector reform.

## The 'Community Map' Concept

- The proposed 'Community Map' is a technological tool that will visually layer different sets of data to provide a holistic view of a community.
- **Layers of information** would include:
  - Healthcare workforce distribution and needs.
  - Community health outcomes and profiles (e.g., prevalence of specific diseases).
  - Social determinants of health such as housing availability, education levels, and economic factors.
- The map would make complex data tangible and powerful, enabling better decision-making for workforce planning and resource allocation.

## Challenges Identified

The group identified several significant barriers to achieving healthy communities that the initiative must consider:

- **Social and Economic Factors**: Critical shortages in housing and a lack of educational opportunities in some communities directly impact the ability to attract and retain a workforce.
- **Healthcare System Constraints**: The current Medicare system, including provider number restrictions, was identified as a constraint to flexible workforce models.
- **Financial Unsustainability**: The high cost of engaging specialists and the 'demand-driven' salary increases for physicians create financial tensions that can make solutions unsustainable for communities.
- **GP Shortages**: Even beyond specialists, there are critical shortages in primary care, such as the GP shortage in East Gippsland.

## Key Insights

- **Two Types of Community**: An important distinction was made between the general 'community' of residents and the specific **'healthcare community'** of professionals. Supporting the integration of new workers into this professional community is key to retention.
- **Reframing Language**: The phrase 'multi-disciplinary care team' carries negative connotations for some practitioners. Reframing it as the 'healthcare community' could break down barriers and foster better collaboration.
- **Economic Responsibility**: It was noted that being economically responsible is a form of patient care. Sustainable financial models are essential for the long-term health of any initiative.

## Next Steps

- **Develop the 'Community Map' Proposal**: Flesh out the concept for the 'Community Map', detailing potential data sources, technology requirements, partnership needs, and a phased implementation plan.
- **Identify Pilot Communities**: Begin identifying one or two potential communities for a pilot project, possibly with contrasting characteristics to allow for a comparative study.
- **Define Initial Data Sets**: Determine which data sets are readily available (e.g., workforce needs assessments) and which need to be sourced from partners (e.g., health outcome data from government departments).
- **Explore Potential Partnerships**: Formalize a list of potential research and implementation partners, such as the **Victorian Health Promotion Foundation**, to learn from their models and leverage existing connections.
