# Service R&D: Prototyping Behaviours Like Features

*The fourth in a 12-part series on breaking the digital doom loop*

## From Soft Skill to Strategic Asset

Imagine running your service culture like a product development laboratory – with prototypes, user testing, iterative improvements, and measurable upgrades. Instead of treating empathy, reliability, and responsiveness as innate qualities that some people have and others don't, what if these capabilities were engineered, refined, and scaled like any other business asset?

This approach – treating service excellence as something you deliberately design rather than hope will emerge naturally – represents a fundamental shift in how organisations can build sustainable competitive advantage. It's what I call Service R&D, and it's how leading companies are turning human connection into their most defensible differentiator.

## Why Service R&D Matters Now

Digital transformation has made measurement and iteration standard practice for technology implementations. Organisations routinely run A/B tests on user interfaces, prototype new features, and track performance metrics with scientific rigour. Yet these same organisations often leave their most important customer touchpoints – human interactions – to chance, instinct, and whatever training happened to be available.

This disconnect creates a fundamental vulnerability. If you wouldn't launch a new mobile app without beta testing and user feedback, why would you deploy thousands of staff into daily service interactions without systematically testing and refining the scripts, gestures, recovery procedures, and empathy patterns that define your brand experience?

The organisations that recognise service delivery as an engineerable system – rather than an art form that can't be systematised – are building capabilities that technology alone cannot replicate.

## Global Excellence: Learning from Deliberate Service Design

**IKEA Japan's Cultural Localisation Lab:** When IKEA re-entered the Japanese market in 2017, they didn't just translate their Swedish service model – they built a Service R&D process to adapt every customer interaction for cultural fit. Teams prototyped different greeting styles, tested various approaches to product explanation, and measured customer comfort with different levels of staff assistance.

The result wasn't just successful market entry but a replicable methodology for cultural service adaptation that IKEA now uses across emerging markets. They proved that even seemingly intuitive human behaviours can be systematically tested and improved.

**Decathlon's Global Service Innovation Network:** The French sporting goods retailer operates in over 70 countries, each with different cultural expectations for customer service. Rather than imposing uniform global standards, Decathlon built what they call "Service Innovation Labs" in each region.

Store teams prototype micro-behaviours – from how they approach customers browsing specific product categories to how they handle returns and exchanges. These experiments are measured through rapid feedback loops, and successful innovations are shared across the global network through their internal platform.

Australian Decathlon stores have contributed service innovations around outdoor equipment consultation and community event integration that have since been adopted across their Asia-Pacific operations. Their approach treats every customer interaction as an opportunity for systematic learning and improvement.

## Building Your Service R&D Laboratory

The most effective Service R&D programs share five core components that any organisation can implement:

**Observe Reality First:** Before designing improvements, map what actually happens in current service interactions. Record real customer conversations (with permission), shadow staff during typical service moments, and document where emotional connection is gained or lost. This baseline observation reveals the gap between intended service and delivered experience.

**Prototype Micro-Behaviours:** Instead of overhauling entire service processes, focus on small, testable changes. Try different opening greetings, experiment with response templates that include empathy cues, test various approaches to service recovery after problems occur. Keep experiments small enough to measure but significant enough to matter.

**Gather Feedback Rapidly:** Implement quick feedback mechanisms for both customers and staff. Simple three-question surveys delivered immediately after service interactions provide more useful data than comprehensive surveys delivered weeks later. Ask specific questions: "Did the interaction feel genuine?" "Would you be comfortable returning?" "What made the biggest difference?"

**Iterate Monthly:** Treat service capabilities like software releases – regular updates based on testing results. Keep what works, refine what doesn't, and continuously experiment with new approaches. This rhythm prevents service standards from stagnating while ensuring changes are evidence-based rather than assumption-driven.

**Share Learning Systematically:** Document and distribute successful service innovations across the organisation like product updates. Version your empathy processes, share best practices through internal platforms, and celebrate teams that contribute breakthrough insights about human connection.

## Why Leaders Embrace This Approach

Service R&D resonates with business leaders because it transforms intangible cultural concepts into manageable business processes:

**Tangible Results:** Service stops being an abstract "culture thing" and becomes a measurable capability with clear performance indicators and improvement trajectories.

**Inclusive Innovation:** Every team member becomes a service designer, contributing insights and testing improvements. This democratises innovation beyond traditional R&D departments.

**Evidence-Based Decisions:** Service investments can be justified through data rather than intuition, making it easier to secure resources and demonstrate ROI.

**Scalable Excellence:** Successful service innovations can be replicated across teams, locations, and markets, multiplying the impact of individual breakthroughs.

Most importantly, this approach preserves and enhances humanity rather than systematising it away. By deliberately designing for empathy, organisations ensure that efficiency improvements strengthen rather than weaken emotional connection.

## Australian Innovation: Service R&D in Practice

Several Australian organisations have developed sophisticated Service R&D capabilities that demonstrate the commercial value of this approach:

**Aveo Group** (recognised by the Customer Service Institute of Australia) built their aged care service excellence through systematic behaviour prototyping. They test everything from how staff greet family members to how they handle difficult conversations about care transitions. Each service innovation is measured for both operational efficiency and emotional impact on residents and families.

**Transdev Sydney Ferries** treats passenger service as an evolving product line. They prototype different approaches to accessibility assistance, test various communication styles during service disruptions, and continuously refine how crews balance safety requirements with customer care. Their service innovations have contributed to consistently high public transport satisfaction ratings.

## The Competitive Advantage

Organisations that master Service R&D create competitive advantages that are extraordinarily difficult to replicate. Technology can be copied, processes can be reverse-engineered, but service culture built through systematic human behaviour development becomes embedded in organisational DNA.

These capabilities compound over time. Each service innovation builds on previous insights, creating increasingly sophisticated approaches to human connection that competitors cannot simply purchase or implement quickly.

## The Leadership Challenge

Service R&D requires leaders to think differently about human capabilities – not as fixed traits that people either possess or lack, but as learnable skills that can be developed through systematic practice and feedback.

This shift in perspective opens extraordinary possibilities. If empathy can be prototyped and kindness can be scaled, then service excellence becomes a strategic capability that organisations can build deliberately rather than hope will emerge accidentally.

**The fundamental question for leaders:** What aspect of your customer or colleague interactions could be improved through systematic testing and refinement? What would happen if you treated service delivery with the same innovation rigour you apply to product development?

The organisations that answer these questions practically – by building Service R&D capabilities – will find themselves with sustainable competitive advantages rooted in human excellence that no amount of competitor technology investment can match.

Service R&D proves that empathy can be engineered and excellence can be scaled without sacrificing authenticity. The secret isn't perfection – it's systematic iteration toward increasingly meaningful human connection.
