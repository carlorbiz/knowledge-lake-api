# The Service Value Gap: How COVID Crippled Our Service Muscle – and How Leaders Are Rebuilding

*The second in a 12-part series on breaking the digital doom loop*

## When Values on the Wall Meet Reality in the Corridor

Every organisation I encounter believes it's customer-centric. Mission statements overflow with aspirational language: *empathy*, *trust*, *collaboration*, *putting people first*. Leadership presentations are filled with customer journey maps and experience design frameworks.

Yet the lived reality often tells a different story. Customers encounter tired staff delivering robotic responses. Digital journeys feel more like obstacle courses than support systems. Internal teams operate in silos that would make their stated values laugh.

This disconnect – between the values on the boardroom wall and the behaviours in the corridor – is what I call the **service value gap**. And COVID-19 didn't just widen that gap; it turned it into a canyon that many organisations are still struggling to bridge.

## The Great Service Skills Drain

The pandemic created a perfect storm for service culture erosion across virtually every industry:

**Mentoring Vanished Overnight:** New hires never observed what exceptional service looked like in practice. The informal apprenticeship that traditionally passed service wisdom from experienced staff to newcomers simply disappeared in remote and hybrid environments.

**Institutional Memory Walked Out the Door:** Skilled service professionals left entire industries – hospitality, retail, healthcare, financial services – taking decades of accumulated knowledge about reading customers, managing difficult situations, and creating moments of genuine care.

**Survival Metrics Dominated:** Leaders understandably focused on keeping operations alive – occupancy rates, throughput targets, compliance measures, cost containment. Emotional intelligence and relationship-building skills took a back seat to pure operational efficiency.

**Connection Infrastructure Collapsed:** The coffee machine conversations, the post-meeting debriefs, the casual corridor check-ins – all the informal feedback loops that kept service tone and empathy calibrated across teams – evaporated in hybrid work arrangements.

For many organisations, service culture didn't just pause during the pandemic. It atrophied like an unused muscle, leaving teams functionally but not emotionally equipped to serve customers in 2024's more demanding environment.

## Why Digital Band-Aids Made Things Worse

Faced with depleted service capabilities, leaders instinctively reached for technological solutions: contactless check-ins, expanded self-service portals, more sophisticated chatbots, automated response systems. These tools promised efficiency gains while reducing reliance on human interaction – exactly what stretched organisations needed.

But here's what the implementation often missed: automation cannot replace the feeling of being genuinely cared for. When staff feel unsupported, unrecognised, or unclear about their role in creating meaningful customer experiences, customers immediately sense that disconnection, regardless of how sophisticated the surrounding technology might be.

The fundamental issue isn't lack of operational efficiency – it's the loss of emotional connection, both between colleagues and between staff and customers.

## Global Examples of Deliberate Rebuilding

However, some organisations have recognised this challenge and responded with intentional service culture reconstruction. Their approaches offer valuable lessons for leaders facing similar recovery challenges.

**Singapore Airlines** never stopped investing in what they call "anticipatory service" – the ability of frontline staff to recognise and respond to unspoken customer needs. Even during the pandemic's worst operational periods, they maintained cultural training programs, understanding that their reputation for genuine care was their primary competitive differentiator. Their FUS3ION program specifically focuses on treating internal colleagues as customers, recognising that external service excellence begins with internal service quality.

**John Lewis Partnership** in the UK, facing enormous retail pressures, doubled down on their "Partnership Principles" – the cultural framework that makes every employee a stakeholder in customer outcomes. Rather than cutting training budgets, they expanded coaching programs to help staff navigate increasingly complex customer expectations in both digital and physical environments. Their 2025 ranking as the UK's top retailer for customer service reflects this cultural investment paying dividends.

**Monzo Bank** in the UK built their entire competitive strategy around service culture, even as a digital-first challenger bank. Their customer service team operates with radical transparency – customers can see exactly what's happening with their queries, and staff are empowered to solve problems without multiple approval layers. This approach has earned them consistently high customer satisfaction ratings despite operating primarily through mobile interfaces.

Closer to home, **Australian organisations recognised by the Customer Service Institute of Australia** – including HCF Health Insurance and Aveo Group – have invested heavily in rebuilding service fundamentals rather than simply layering new technology over existing gaps.

## The Service Muscle Recovery Program

For leaders recognising that their organisation's service culture needs deliberate rebuilding, the recovery process requires three core commitments:

**Re-immersion in Customer Reality:** Senior leaders must regularly experience their own service delivery firsthand. This isn't about catching staff doing things wrong – it's about understanding where the current experience creates friction, confusion, or disconnection. Many successful service leaders now schedule quarterly "mystery customer" sessions, experiencing their own organisation's service journey without identification or special treatment.

**Micro-coaching Over Macro-training:** Rather than expensive, infrequent training events, the most effective recovery programs focus on brief, regular coaching moments. Fifteen-minute peer sessions focused on single behaviours – active listening techniques, recovery from service failures, or maintaining empathy under pressure – prove more sustainable and effective than day-long workshops that staff struggle to remember or implement.

**Story Capture and Retelling:** Every organisation has examples of exceptional service happening daily – they're just not systematically captured or celebrated. Creating simple processes for collecting and sharing internal stories of care done well proves cheaper and more powerful than external training programs. These stories become the cultural DNA that new staff can absorb and experienced staff can build upon.

## The Strategic Imperative

This isn't about returning to pre-pandemic service levels – customer expectations have evolved significantly. It's about building service culture that can thrive in hybrid environments, leverage technology effectively, and create genuine competitive advantage.

The organisations that emerge strongest from this period will be those that recognised the service value gap early and invested deliberately in closing it. They understand that digital transformation amplifies whatever culture exists beneath it, so building robust service culture isn't a nice-to-have – it's a strategic imperative.

## The Leadership Choice

Every leader faces a choice: continue investing primarily in technological solutions while hoping service culture will somehow regenerate spontaneously, or treat service culture rebuilding as a core business priority that requires the same systematic attention given to financial performance and operational efficiency.

The evidence suggests that organisations taking the second approach are not only recovering faster from pandemic disruptions – they're building competitive advantages that technology alone cannot replicate.

**The fundamental question for leaders:** Which parts of your service culture were lost during the pandemic disruption, and what specific investments will rebuild them stronger than before?

The service value gap isn't just a customer experience problem – it's a business performance issue that affects staff engagement, operational efficiency, and ultimately, financial results. Closing that gap requires acknowledging that service culture is a business asset that needs active management, not a soft skill that develops naturally over time.

The leaders who make this investment now will find themselves with sustainable competitive advantages that no amount of competitor technology spending can match.
