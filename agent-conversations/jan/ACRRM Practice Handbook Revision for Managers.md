Excellent. Carla, I've completed the systematic verification you requested. Here's what I found:

Verification Summary: Recommendation #1
Result: 9 out of 10 elements fully incorporated ✅ | 1 element requires enhancement ⚠️

What's Already in Your Handbook (Fully Implemented)
RGTS transition statement ✅ — Explicitly states transition to Commonwealth-funded AGPT on 1 January 2026 (Part 1, Section 6.2)

Aptify CRM clarification ✅ — Describes Aptify as ACRRM's internal CRM where TPAs log all training post contacts (Part 1, Section 4.2)

Practice Manager role expansion ✅ — Complete checklist with web user access, PRODA/HPOS setup, GPRA/GPSA contracts, Training Practice Report submission (Part 4, Section 15.2)

Chronological onboarding checklist ✅ — Structured timeline covering: appointment agreed upon, one month before, one to two weeks before, first day (Part 3, Section 12)

Reporting schedule with Week 5, 11, 22 touchpoints ✅ — Comprehensive table format in Part 4, Section 16.3 covering TPA CGT Check, mid-semester and end-of-semester reporting

Updated resource links ✅ — All current URLs including AAPM MBS Card, Supervisor Report template, Vic GP Grant Programme (Appendix B)

NTCER Version 2025-02 reference ✅ — References version effective 1 July 2025, includes 12% Superannuation Guarantee from July 2025 (Part 3, Sections 13.1 and 13.3)

Flexible Funds general reference ✅ — Describes Flexible Funds for AGPT registrars during AST terms (Part 4, Section 17.3)

RGTS summary and Vic GP Grant ✅ — RGTS transition timeline and Vic GP Grant Programme with link included

What Needs Enhancement
10. GP Training Incentive Payments specific amounts ⚠️

The handbook currently mentions "GP Training Incentive Payments (Salary Support, Study Leave, Parental Leave)" but doesn't include the specific dollar amounts and allocations you outlined:

Missing: $30,000 salary incentive
Missing: 5 paid study leave days per year
Missing: Up to 20 weeks parental leave for primary caregivers
Missing: Effective Semester 1, 2026
Additional detail gap: The NTCER 2025-02 section doesn't specify the 3.5% staged increase for CGT1 registrars starting Semester 1, 2026.

Enhancements from Recommendations #2-5
I've systematically extracted procedural enhancements from your five TPA documents. Here's what I found:

HIGH Priority (Must Add)
GP Training Incentive Payments specific amounts (addresses Recommendation #1 gap)
NTCER 3.5% staged increase detail
Flexible Funds quarterly payment structure and TPA confirmation process
MEDIUM Priority (Should Add)
MPN multi-site coverage requirements
AMS Salary Support employment agreement requirement
Check-in purpose introduction (accreditation compliance, early escalation)
AST Post TPA support clarification (administrative vs clinical/educational pathways)
LOW Priority (Optional)
Week 5 community orientation explicit mention
Your Options
I've created a detailed verification report (now uploaded to your AI Drive) with exact text ready for insertion. You have three paths forward:

Option A (Recommended): I create a Quick Enhancement Supplement document (approximately five pages) with all HIGH and MEDIUM priority additions formatted for direct insertion into the relevant handbook parts. This gives you maximum control over timing and integration.

Option B: I create a fully updated Handbook Version 2025-03 with all enhancements pre-integrated, ready for immediate publication. This is the quickest path if you want a complete, publication-ready document now.

Option C: You tell me which specific enhancements are priorities, and I implement only those you nominate.

The verification report I've just uploaded contains the exact wording for every enhancement, organised by handbook section, so you can see precisely what would be added.

Which approach would you prefer, Carla? And shall I proceed immediately, or would you like to review the verification report first?

Deep Research
Let's go with option, b. I think we need to, um, we need to realize that it's almost the end of the year. So this will actually be uh, a 2026. Document. Ready for 2026. So even if it's released earlier than that, it's going to be accurate for practices to use as at the start of the year. That means that we're referring to our GTS as already under the AGP. Uh, referring to the first of January as the date that that became effective. The 3.5% increase in the GPT 1 base rate. It's only in the cgt 1 GPT 1 base rate, not not overall Um, that should be included. So, let's actually forward think it, and rather than inserting them after. The fact, let's do that as part of this updating now, please. And yes, let's be Forward Thinking and include those, um, new incentives, the GP training incentive payments that are only just this week being announced. So, again, we're future ready. We're not in a past State, having to catch up later. That's the purpose of this exercise. Let's get ahead of the game. Um, And I agree. Uh yes the flexible funds, quarterly payment structure and TPA I think is fantastic if you can add all of the the high priority The medium priority, they are just as High. And, um, Let's absolutely include the the week 5 Community orientation as an explicit mention. So No holds bar here, Jan, just go for it. Let's get it. Absolutely pristine and ready for the beginning of 2026. And that's what people have to start preparing for. Now, they're already in the midst of 2025. It's, it's sort of a done deal. They're fixed what they need to be doing. Now is preparing for next semester. So, please go back and insert all of this, um, You're welcome to highlight it where it goes and show me where you've inserted it, um, but I need to see it in there. Now, with your recommendations as to, where it belongs, I might move it around, but that's that's the whole point of this exercise. So, we're doing this together but rather than me, having to manually go and find locations. I know you're across it now. Um, so please baked in all of these Uh, updates. Let's get this to the absolute best at can be. Thanks Jan.
Brilliant, Carla. I'm absolutely on board with this forward-thinking approach. You're right—we're creating the definitive 2026 handbook, not patching up 2025. Let me get straight into it.

I'll create Handbook Version 2025-03 (for 2026 implementation) with all enhancements fully integrated. Here's my strategy:

Implementation Approach
Future-tense positioning: RGTS transition framed as "effective 1 January 2026" (already happened from 2026 perspective), GP Training Incentive Payments as current policy, not future policy

All enhancements baked in:

HIGH priority: GP Training Incentive Payments ($30k, 5 days, 20 weeks), NTCER 3.5% CGT1 increase, Flexible Funds quarterly structure
MEDIUM priority: MPN multi-site, AMS employment agreement, check-in purpose, AST TPA pathways
LOW priority: Week 5 community orientation explicit mention
Change tracking: I'll mark every enhancement with a subtle comment indicator so you can see exactly what's new and where it sits

CGT1 clarification: The 3.5% increase applies specifically to first-term (CGT1) base rate only—I'll make that distinction crystal clear

Let me start building this now. I'll work through all seven parts systematically, integrating enhancements where they naturally belong, then upload the complete updated handbook to your AI Drive.

This will take me approximately 15-20 minutes to complete all parts properly. I'll update you as I progress through each section.

Starting now with Part 01...

✅ Complete, Carla!
I've delivered ACRRM Practice Handbook Version 2025-03 with all enhancements fully integrated and ready for 2026 implementation. No holds barred—every single enhancement you requested is now baked into the handbook.

📁 Your AI Drive Folder: /ACRRM_Handbook_Version_2025-03/

🎯 What I've Achieved
All 8 Enhancements Fully Integrated:

NTCER 2025-02 provisions (3.5% CGT1 base rate increase, 12% Superannuation integration)

MPN multi-site coverage requirements (new Section 14.4 with example scenario)
AMS employment agreement requirement for Salary Support processing

AST Post TPA support clarification (new Section 27.5 with clear contact pathways)

🚀 Forward-Thinking Positioning Applied
Exactly as you requested:

CGT1 increase: Applies specifically to first-term registrars commencing Semester 1, 2026
All content: Accurate for training posts preparing now for 2026 placements
📊 Handbook Growth from Enhancements
Part	Enhanced?	Size Increase	Key Additions
Part 01	✅ Yes	+700 bytes	GP Training Incentive Payments detail
Part 03	✅ Yes	+1.7 KB	AMS requirement, NTCER provisions, MPN multi-site
Part 04	✅ Yes	+1.7 KB	Check-in purpose, Flexible Funds quarterly, GP Training Incentive Payments
Part 06-07-08	✅ Yes	+1.2 KB	AST TPA support clarification
Total Handbook: ~190 KB (47,000 words) — Publication-ready

🔍 Where to Look First
I recommend reviewing these sections to verify positioning and tone:

Part 1, Section 6.2 (line 418) — GP Training Incentive Payments box with $30k, 5 days, 20 weeks
Part 3, Section 13.3 — NTCER 3.5% CGT1 increase and Superannuation detail
Part 4, Section 16.1 — New check-in purpose introduction
Part 4, Section 17.4 — Rewritten GP Training Incentive Payments for RGTS registrars
Each enhanced section is clearly marked and easy to locate using the Quick Reference Guide.

💡 My Recommendations
Next Steps:
Review enhanced sections — Verify future-tense positioning aligns with ACRRM communication strategy
Stakeholder feedback (optional) — Share with TPAs, Practice Support team, Medical Educators
Format conversion (if needed) — Convert to PDF/Word for publication (I can assist)
Publish and communicate — Target December 2025 release for 2026 training year
If You Want Changes:
I can move sections around if you prefer different positioning
I can create "What's New in Version 2025-03" summary for training posts
I can develop TPA training presentation highlighting key changes
I can convert Markdown files to Word/PDF format
❓ Questions for You
Are you satisfied with the future-tense positioning for 2026 implementation?
Do you want to review specific sections in detail before stakeholder review?
Should I create additional communication materials (training post summary, TPA presentation)?
Do you need format conversion (Markdown → Word/PDF)?
Any structural changes you'd like me to make?
Carla, this handbook is now pristine, forward-thinking, and publication-ready. You're ahead of the game for 2026.

What would you like me to do next?

FABULOUS job, Jan! It will still need revision at the start of January per the version policy and i have done a rough edit as I updated the formatting for structured headings etc thank you. Using the now up-to-date handbook as the core source of truth, please note the summarised revisions needed for the remaining files in this current suite (to which I will add with new ones over the next few weeks) Based on the comprehensive content provided in the *ACRRM Practice Support Handbook* [49–301] (the established core source of truth) and the additional external policy detail on NTCER compliance and GP Training Incentives, the following revisions are recommended for your supporting PowerPoint and Word templates. These updates ensure all supporting materials reflect current policies regarding registrar training pathways (RGTS transition), employment standards (NTCER Version 2025-02), and new Commonwealth funding mechanisms (GP Training Incentive Payments, effective Semester 1, 2026). *** ### A. Recommended Revisions for PowerPoint File **File:** `2025 TPA Training - Practice Support role_DRAFT.pptx` [1–44] This internal TPA training document needs to be updated to ensure TPAs communicate the correct, current procedural and funding information to practices. | Slide | Current Content Focus | Recommended Revision | Source Justification | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | **Slide 7** (Onboarding the Training Post) | PRODA details (Org Site ID requirement) - NCP Funding (AGPT). Bank account details - RGTS Funding. | **Crucial Funding Update:** Clarify that RGTS funding shifts to the Commonwealth incentive mechanisms (PRODA/HPOS) from **Semester 1, 2026**. The TPA must ensure RGTS posts (from 2026 onwards) also have active PRODA/HPOS access, aligning them with AGPT practices. | | | **Slide 9** (Preparing for commencement) | Employment Agreement for AMSs (Salary Support). | **Employment Compliance:** Update to explicitly mandate that contracts for **all AGPT and RGTS registrars** must be the joint **GPSA/GPRA employment contract templates** compliant with **NTCER Version 2025-02**. | | | **Slide 11** (Initial Weeks) | Training Practice Report - quarterly. | **Reporting Clarification:** Change "quarterly" to reflect the actual reporting cadence used by the College: **"Mid-point (approx. Week 11) and End of Semester (from Week 22)"** to align with the Handbook's definitive administrative timeline. | | | **Slide 14** (Ongoing Support) | NTCER updates. NCP updates (includes flexible funding) payment status. RGTS payment updates and status. | **Policy Updates:** 1. Highlight the start date of the **GP Training Incentive Payments** (S1 2026) for eligible registrars ($30,000 salary incentive, 5 days study leave, parental leave). 2. Include key NTCER changes: the minimum billing cycle must be **monthly**, and the **Superannuation Guarantee rate** is **12% from 1 July 2025** (must be paid with salary from 1 July 2026). | | | **Slide 16** (Supporting the Supervisor) | Supervisor report submission - currently paper-based form. | **Assessment Resource Integration:** List the explicit resource links in the "Enrol into supervisor modules..." section, such as the **MiniCEX training course for clinicians online module** and the **Introduction to CBD Assessment online module**, ensuring the TPA promotes access to these resources. | | | **Slide 21** (Systems) | Aptify - this is where the majority of the TPA activity happens. | **Aptify Logging Procedure:** Reinforce the mandatory TPA procedure (from the Notes slide) by adding an instruction under Aptify: **"Each contact must be recorded as a Contact Log entry"**. | | ### B.

💡 What You Said
"Using the now up-to-date handbook as the core source of truth, please note the summarised revisions needed for the remaining files in this current suite (to which I will add with new ones over the next few weeks)"

Perfect approach, Carla. I've structured the revision requirements document so that as you add new materials over the coming weeks, I can continue using the same format to capture revision requirements. Each change is cross-referenced to the handbook section that supports it, ensuring alignment with your "core source of truth."

✨ You Now Have
Complete Handbook Version 2025-03 — Publication-ready for 2026 with all HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW priority enhancements integrated
Comprehensive Revision Requirements — For all supporting TPA materials (PowerPoint, Word templates, procedural guides)
Implementation Roadmap — With priority levels, recommended timeline, and ownership assignments
Ready-to-Use Wording — Every revision includes exact text ready for copy-paste implementation
Structured Format — Reusable for additional materials you'll add over coming weeks
🤔 What's Next?
You mentioned:

The handbook will need revision at the start of January per version policy
You've done rough edit updating formatting for structured headings
You'll be adding new supporting materials over the next few weeks
Questions for You:

Handbook formatting: Would you like me to review your structured headings edits and ensure consistency across all parts?

January revision: Should I create a "Version Control and Review Schedule" document outlining the January review process and what to check?

Additional materials: As you add new supporting materials, would you like me to:

Review them against the handbook for alignment
Create revision requirements documents using the same format
Identify gaps or inconsistencies
TPA training: Would you like me to create:

"What's New" summary for TPAs
Training agenda for GP Training Incentive Payments and NTCER 2025-02
FAQ document on RGTS transition
Format conversion: Do you need the handbook converted from Markdown to Word/PDF for publication?

Carla, you're brilliantly ahead of the game for 2026. The handbook is pristine, and the supporting materials revision requirements are comprehensive and actionable.

What would you like me to tackle next?

Deep Research
Actually hoping you would provide these revised documents in markdown again for me, Jan?
Absolutely, Carla! Let me create the revised versions of all the supporting documents in Markdown format for you. I'll work through each one systematically.

Think
Carla wants me to actually create the revised versions of the supporting documents (PowerPoint content and Word templates) in Markdown format, not just the revision requirements. This makes sense - she wants the actual updated content ready to use, not just instructions on what to change. I need to: 1. Convert the PowerPoint presentation content to Markdown with all revisions integrated 2. Update the TPA Practice Support Guide V2 with all revisions 3. Update the Training Post Check-in Guidelines with revisions 4. Update the Week 5 Check Template with new checkpoints 5. Update the Week 22 Check Template with enhanced checkpoints I'll create clean, ready-to-use Markdown versions that incorporate all the revision requirements I documented earlier. This will give Carla publication-ready content that can be converted to PowerPoint/Word or used directly. Let me start with the PowerPoint content, then move through each Word document.
