can you access my Drive folder "collab folder - First Nations Mapping"? I need to prepare a briefing paper for the Commonwealth based on the report I provided in the meeting last week for which you created an updated project timeline. Can you please draft this for me based on this meeting transcript (typos galore - phonetic spelling sorry) - I'll jump in so it's Carla. Um, And I'd like to say, again, thank you to the department for the opportunity on behalf of gpsi, and gpra to undertake this body of work, it is Um, It's limited in terms of the timing.

To Output, probably what it deserves as a project. But we have at this stage. Well, between September through to December. Our project was to undertake literature review and Analysis. Um, so desktop review. Survey questionnaire. Development. Stakeholder identification. Then conference questionnaire deployment. And the Commonwealth presentation, stakeholder, direct engagement data synthesis and Analysis report writing q a and final delivery before the end of December.

Taking into account Christmas. Unavailability of people, we're trying to compact as much as possible into these first couple of months to ensure we maximise the opportunity to collect and analyse, a really rich scope of data for the department. So the literature review and Analysis was undertaken through September, that's completed.

So, um, the desktop research, The survey and stakehold. The generator development has been completed. Stakeholder identification. It's been completed as a broad level and now it comes down to who we can actually. Um, capture to have discussions with, and to get the data from in, through the survey. If not face to face or online, And the opportunity comes up of course.

Next week with our May conference, the GP 25 conference I hate a conference so there are touch points where we will actually get to see people but I'm sure that we will actually get through. Um, the bulk of these stakeholder discussions. In the next six weeks. That's, that's a certainty.

It's it's our goal and we make it. So between two Kirsten and dpra that is being undertaken, currently. Um and then December, we have set aside for the final data synthesis and Analysis and the report writing So, we have Quite a few deliverables there already in the tank for presentation on the 27th of October, by which stage will also have had some Um, really reach discussions.

In person. Um, the key stakeholders and be undirected out to various ams's and Individual. Um, supervisors and registrars, not just the, uh, Management level of the different facilities around the country. So, we believe we're on track and um, Yeah, we we're looking We're not just looking for the gaps, we're looking for the solutions to ensure that there's something really Really worthwhile coming out of this.
