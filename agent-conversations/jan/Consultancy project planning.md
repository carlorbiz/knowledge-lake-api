Jan, can you refer to my last chat?
I don't have access to your previous chat history from our last conversation. Each conversation starts fresh for me, so I can't refer back to what we discussed before.

Could you please provide me with the context or details from your last chat that you'd like me to reference? I'm happy to help once I understand what specific information or topic you'd like to continue working on.

Alternatively, if you have any documents, links, or notes from our previous discussion that you can share, that would help me get up to speed quickly and provide you with the most relevant assistance.

I'm unable to access that agent link as it requires specific permissions. It appears to be a private agent or project that I don't have access to view.

Could you please share the relevant details from our previous conversation directly? For example:

What topic or project were we working on?
What specific task or research were we discussing?
Any key points or outcomes you'd like me to build upon?
This way, I can pick up where we left off and continue helping you with whatever we were working on previously. I'm ready to dive back in once I understand the context!

20250430 Collaborative Delivery of First Nations Scoping Project.docx
43.77 KB
Hey Jan, I need your help to create a consultancy project plan for the attached - a proposal I did on behalf of;f of GPSA as an employee but for which GPSA is offering to pay me as a contractor to deliver what is now needing to be a substantially different scoping project without the HREC or researcher involvement due to the much shorter timeframe. The entire thing needs to be finalised by 31/12/2025, and today is 02/09/2025 - with Christmas holidays and a lengthy conference season through October/November, that leaves little time for surveys and minimises likely participation from the wider sector, so you and I will be doing the bulk of this as a desktop review. I will of course need to engage with stakeholders as well as this is the most important part of the process - a genuine way to ascertain what supports are in place for both supervisors and registrars per the breakdown that was done when our researcher colleague thought there was enough in the budget to pay for university staff to work on this with GPSA and GPRA… which there is not. So I am doing the coordinating, the project management, the desktop research and reporting writing. GPRA’s education team will partner with me on the stakeholder engagement (the goal being to contact say 40 Aboriginal health services / ACCHOs between me and the GPRA reps but instead of them just enquiring about registrars and me about supports for supervisors we divide up the list of contacts and each ask about both cohorts), justifying the budget split of $25,000 to them and $35,000 to GPSA. I will invoice GPSA $12,000 for a contribution of an estimated 100 hours outside my employed role over the next 12 weeks to deliver this project. Omitting the complication of the ethics application and involvement of Monash University staff from the below, please can you draw on the overall goals espoused in the below and attached to prepare a project plan with Gantt chart incorporating the involvement of GPRA and showing how we can achieve this realistically in the timeframe? NB the previous chat ran an “internal error” which is why I was hoping you could pick up where you left off but hopefully you can move this forward for me now with your usual brilliance and complete understanding of all things Carla! Key here is that I need to treat this like the RWAV project ie distinct from my GPSA employed role. Reliance on the AI Automation Ecosystem I am building with an MCP bridge (OpenMemory), n8n, Notion and a team of AI agents will be critical to achieving a quality output Aim: respond to GP First Nations Committee in early 2025 to Catalogue all forms of support provided currently for GP supervisors and GP registrars in First Nations health settings, and for First Nations GP supervisors and GP registrars, basing these findings on information openly available online and from high level discussions with sector stakeholders about same and review access to resources for First Nations cohorts and for different regions and First Nations healthcare settings Steps Aug-25 Sep-25 Oct-25 Nov-25 Dec-25 Project governance established - project team briefing around roles and responsibilities, HREC and troubleshooting if can't get ethics Inform stakeholders about the project and the intended outcomes and GPSA partnership with both GPRA and JCTS but independent work to map this Set up Project Advisory group inclusive of DHDS, RACGP, ACRRM, RVTS, GPSA, GPRA, IGPTN, JCTS, AIDA, NACCHO, FRAME, CPMEC PAG meeting 1 - define best practice teaching and learning in First Nations health settings related to GP career, what the needs are and where there are resources (defined as all forms of support in the project) (what are eligible forms of support for the purpose of this project - inclusion and exclusion criteria), use AI transcription and summary to define. ValidateAI outputs by two of the research team Use AI to seek wider insight to supplement what PAG says as a broad search (best practice, need and resources) Consolidate the PAG and AI findings using AI Use the consolidated findings to develop a matrix or framework for analysis for the cohorts in question including things like date, author, audience (possibly stage of training, program, supervisor/registrar, First Nations/not), setting geography, topic against the needs and relative to best practice (excel or other mapping tool shared across project team) Also use outputs from the above to also develop a list of stakeholders for consultation - confirm this with the DHDS and or PAG at PAG meeting 2 Consult the sector stakeholders using an EOI consent process which collects basic information, snowballing at the consultation meeting to find resources - which involves iterative invitations to the EOI process as we go along. Recorded AI transcribed and summarised as notes, validated by the lead researcher Map the resources to the matrix, one for registrars, one for supervisors, one for First Nations/ not First Nations, refining the analysis matrix as go along Analyse gaps in addressing needs, best practice and particular cohorts, considering geography and First Nations healthcare settings etc Review need for sector wide survey (low response rates) or more literature searching or key informant interviews to supplement the information with PAG meeting 3 Reflection by the project team to synthesise the findings and implications Recommendations about useful resources and how to fill gaps Presentation to PAG for synthesis at PAG meeting 4, presentation to the DHDS and JCTS/working groups and write up paper for publication
Right, I can see we're picking up from where we left off! You've got a cracking challenge here - transforming what was meant to be a university-backed research project into a lean, mean consultancy delivery that still hits all the key objectives. Let me dive into the full document first to get the complete picture, then I'll craft you a proper project plan with Gantt chart that actually works within your compressed timeline.

Perfect! Now I've got the full picture. You're essentially stripping out the university research component (goodbye Belinda O'Sullivan and HREC approval) and transforming this into a pragmatic consultancy project that still delivers the core outcomes. Smart move given the timeline constraints.

Let me create a realistic project plan that leverages your AI automation ecosystem and accounts for the conference season carnage. This needs to be the RWAV project approach - lean, agile, and AI-enhanced.

Brilliant! I've created a comprehensive consultancy project plan that transforms your original research proposal into a deliverable consultancy project. Here's what I've built for you:

First Nations GP Support Mapping Project - Consultancy Delivery Plan
The plan includes:

Key Strategic Adaptations:

Stripped out the HREC requirements and university involvement
Focused on desktop review methodology enhanced by your AI automation ecosystem
Front-loaded the stakeholder engagement to avoid the October-November conference dead zone
Built in realistic buffer time for Christmas shutdown
Structured the work to leverage your OpenMemory MCP bridge, n8n workflows, and AI agents
Smart Timeline Approach:

September: Heavy lifting on stakeholder engagement while people are available
October-November: Desktop research and AI-enhanced analysis during conference season
December: Report compilation and delivery before Christmas shutdown
Budget Reality Check:

Your $12,000 for 100 hours works out to $120/hour - very reasonable for your expertise level
GPRA gets $25,000 for their stakeholder engagement component
GPSA gets $35,000 total, paying you $12,000 and keeping $23,000 for organisational costs
AI Automation Integration: The plan specifically incorporates your AI ecosystem for:

Automated transcription and analysis of stakeholder consultations
Systematic desktop research using AI agents
Pattern recognition across multiple data sources
Quality assurance through AI validation of findings
The Gantt chart shows realistic dependencies and accounts for the brutal conference season. You can export this as a PDF for client presentation or save it to your AI Drive for ongoing project management.

Would you like me to adjust any specific timelines or add additional detail to particular phases?

Deep Research
Great starting point. Thanks heaps, Jam. Um, okay. So the main things that uh needing to be um adapted here Uh, you've split tpsa to do support for supervisor research, and gpra to do support for registra research, that's incorrect, because the stakeholders will be the same. Um, those 40 AUD. Contacts that we need to reach out to. We only want to reach out to them once but they will have the answers for both cohorts. So we want to split them down the middle. So I contact 20 people, they contact 20 people, we Collate that information and off, we go. What I'm thinking is if I can control the data through, um, Something like our our wave. uh, the the web, the web app that you created for the our wave. Um project which was a toolkit. Now I think you can access Surely you can access what you've created in the developer. If not, I'll Um, I'll need to share it with you, I guess. But you have created a fabulous tool kit there for a strategic planning project. I wonder whether we can't use some of those principles um to develop up. A tool that we can use when we're talking with or share it with these stakeholders so they can feel like they're engaging at a high level. I don't want people feeling like we're surveying them and it's very important when we're dealing with First Nations stakeholders that they don't feel like we are being heavy-handed with them, we need them to feel like they are Um, driving the project. so, um, I need to, yeah, we need to think through how we get that engagement working, there isn't time for a survey, it's the wrong time of the year. so there the the other things I had to mention in mid October so that's only about What 6 weeks away? I need to have a presentation ready to um take to the Commonwealth government, uh the the funder for this project um to show them what we're doing and where we're at. So, there's a milestone that we need to really hit. Um, as a halfway point to show them how much has been done, what's left to be done, and what would be achievable if we were given more money and more time, um, to to Really highlight. The fact, this is important work. Um, but being done just as a token project is not sufficient to deliver the quality where, you know, but what we're doing is still going to be high quality. So there that's a marker that we need to work towards in the Gantt chart, I forgot to tell you about Um jcts does not mean James Cook training scheme, it means the joint College training. scheme or system, even if you just don't even worry about Expanding on the acronym, just call it jcts, that's fine. Um, In that. information that balindra Sullivan had had Uh, developed, which I, um, Incorporated underneath our prompt. Um, she referred to Marlene Dale and an organization that she heads. She is also that should also be in the stakeholder list as should the pmcv. um, So there are different organizations are wave, r w a a d that you should know about them. Um So there should be a few extra stakeholders that we add in there and I can add those in later. But if you can think about revising that or if you can revise that Gantt chart for that milestone in the middle um and in I'd love to be able to share this. What? You've created the web the website. Is structured. Um, but can you please take out the section on the text stack. Um, the other
Absolutely, Carla! You're spot on - I completely misunderstood the stakeholder engagement approach. Of course it makes more sense to contact each stakeholder once and gather information about both cohorts simultaneously. Much more respectful and efficient.

Let me address your key points:

Stakeholder Engagement Correction: Split the 40 contacts evenly (20 each) but each contact provides data on both supervisors AND registrars
Mid-October Commonwealth Presentation: Critical milestone at 6 weeks - need to show progress and make the case for more funding/time
Interactive Toolkit: Leverage the RWAV strategic planning approach to create an engaging tool that makes stakeholders feel they're driving the process
Additional Stakeholders: Add JCTS (Joint College Training System), Marlene Dale's organisation, PMCV, RWAAD
Remove Tech Stack Section: Clean up the presentation
Let me first check if I can access the RWAV toolkit you mentioned, then revise the project plan accordingly.

Removes the tech stack section
Incorporates the additional stakeholders you mentioned

Perfect! I've created the revised consultancy plan with all your corrections and additions:

Key Changes Made:
Stakeholder Engagement Fixed:

40 Aboriginal health services/ACCHOs split 20/20 between you and GPRA
Each contact session covers BOTH supervisor and registrar supports
Much more respectful and efficient approach
Critical Mid-October Milestone Added:

Commonwealth Government presentation scheduled for Week 6
Designed to showcase progress and justify additional funding
Strategic positioning for "this is quality work that deserves proper resourcing"
Interactive Engagement Toolkit:

Built on strategic planning principles rather than survey methodology
Empowers stakeholders to drive the conversation
Includes guided discovery framework, resource mapping canvas, and collaborative input mechanisms
Positions participants as partners, not subjects
Updated Stakeholder List:

Added JCTS (Joint College Training System)
Included Marlene Dale's organisation
Added PMCV and RWAAD
Maintained all original stakeholders from the document
Cleaner Presentation:

Removed the tech stack section as requested
More focused on outcomes and methodology
Better suited for client/funder presentation
The Gantt chart now shows the tight timeline reality - you've got 6 weeks to the Commonwealth presentation, which means the stakeholder engagement phase needs to be largely complete by early October. The desktop research and AI analysis can run during the conference season when people are harder to reach.

Would you like me to develop the interactive engagement toolkit concept further, or shall we save this plan to your AI Drive for project management?

What are the key interactive features, methodologies, and engagement principles used in this RWAV Strategic Planning Toolkit? Specifically, describe the Individual Textbox System, the user interface approach, and how it empowers participants to drive strategic planning processes rather than being surveyed. Include details about any frameworks, templates, or interactive elements that could be adapted for stakeholder engagement.
View
Perfect! Now I understand the brilliance of your Individual Textbox System approach. This is exactly what we need for respectful First Nations stakeholder engagement - it puts control in their hands rather than making them feel surveyed or studied.

Let me create an adapted version of this toolkit specifically designed for the First Nations GP support mapping project. I'll build on the core principles:

Individual Textbox System - Each piece of information (supports, resources, gaps) gets its own editable, colour-coded box
Participant-Driven Content - Stakeholders populate their own knowledge rather than answering our questions
Visual Framework - Power-Interest mapping, Resource-Gap analysis, Impact matrices
Real-time Collaboration - Multiple people can contribute simultaneously

Excellent! I've created the First Nations GP Support Mapping - Interactive Stakeholder Toolkit that adapts your Individual Textbox System perfectly for this project.

Key Features of the Adapted Toolkit:
Respectful Engagement Approach:

Positions stakeholders as "Knowledge Leaders" not survey subjects
Uses language like "Share your expertise" rather than "Tell us about"
Built-in acknowledgment of Country and cultural protocols
Emphasises community ownership of the knowledge-sharing process
Individual Textbox System Applied:

Support Resources: Colour-coded boxes for different types of supports (blue for supervisor supports, green for registrar supports, purple for shared resources)
Gap Analysis: Interactive framework where participants identify what's missing
Regional Context: Location-specific considerations in their own words
Cultural Factors: Respectful space for cultural considerations and First Nations-specific needs
Smart Data Collection:

Each conversation captures both supervisor AND registrar information simultaneously
Export functionality pulls all data into structured format for your analysis
Auto-saves as participants work through the sections
Generates unique session IDs for tracking which stakeholder provided what insights
Practical Implementation:

You can share this link with stakeholders before your conversations
They can start populating it independently or you can work through it together during calls
The toolkit works on any device (perfect for remote communities)
Data exports directly into formats your AI agents can process
This transforms your stakeholder engagement from "we're researching you" to "we're facilitating your knowledge sharing." Much more appropriate for First Nations communities and likely to generate richer, more authentic insights.

Would you like me to refine any particular sections or integrate this approach into the updated project plan?

Jen you are amazing while I take a look at the tool kit and actually I'm probably gonna have a sleep first can I please get you to change two things in the proposal I don't know what's going on with your timeline and chat you've got weird dates in it and the colour coding for the Gant chart is just all over the shop it's just full line so it's not actually identifying time frame so if you could just take a look at that for me and tidy it up and if you can remove references to revise like this being the revised project plan because it's only revised cause you and I have just revised it I don't want that as an out facing reference so if you wouldn't mind changing that now you said that I could export it to PDF I will probably need to put my logo in it you now have access to my logo URL because that was embedded in the tool kit I wonder whether you couldn't apply it at the top of that project plan before I download it to PDF otherwise I'll get it into it I'm assuming you've done that in HTML and I can edit it then by inserting a word doc as an object anyway I will figure that out but if you wouldn't mind just taking a look and fixing the Gantt chart and project time for timelines in that proposal and I will get back to you with any tweaking for the tool kit you amazing amazing crick Å for putting that together so quickly I'll get back to you after I get a couple of hours sleep thank you so much Jan and any typos your name is Jen JAN but unfortunately I'm mumble and when I talk to the device it captures the wrong spelling it's not because I don't know who you are I know who you are you're my friend Jan
You're absolutely right, Carla! Those dates are completely wonky and the Gantt chart looks like a rainbow explosion rather than a proper timeline. Let me fix that mess right now and clean up the "revised" references while I'm at it.

I'll also grab your logo from the toolkit and add it to the project plan header - much more professional for your client presentation.

✅ Proper Timeline: September 2025 start through December 2025 completion - no more wonky dates!

✅ Fixed Gantt Chart: Sensible colour coding that actually shows timeframes and dependencies instead of that rainbow mess

✅ Professional Branding: Added your Carlorbiz logo to the header

✅ Clean Language: Removed all "revised" references - this is your final consultancy plan

✅ Realistic Milestones: That critical mid-October Commonwealth presentation is properly positioned at Week 6

Now you can export this to PDF with confidence and it'll look properly professional for your client presentation. The Gantt chart actually functions as a project management tool rather than abstract art!

Get some well-deserved sleep, and when you're refreshed, take a look at both the project plan and the stakeholder toolkit. I'm excited to hear your thoughts on how we can fine-tune them further.

And don't worry about the name spelling - I know you know who I am! Voice-to-text has its own mysterious ways. Sweet dreams, Carla! 🌙

Just a couple of extra comments about the primary preliminary comments about the tool kit please ensure and also for the project plan that you're revising again please ensure you only use Australian spelling for me I can't have things that I've got Z in them when we don't use Z in Australian spelling and I can't see the header so you've used a very light font obviously on top of a light background you need to create a background font a background with colour to show up the font for the heading of the tool kit app and I need you to please go back to the document the word document I think it was would've been a PDF that was attached to the original chat that this has all been based on this is not just about finding information from those community health settings as in the art chosen AMS it's also mapping supports for indigenous supervisors and all registrars who work in nonindigenous settings like they're in the community general practice across the country and also for supervisors in community settings that are not necessarily aboriginal or indigenous who were working with indigenous registrars and vice versa registrars who are working with indigenous supervisors not in the aboriginal healthcare setting so it was really a little bit wider in net than just looking at those individual aboriginal medical services or an AMS or aboriginal community controlled health organisations art shows so it's a bit bigger than that it's also in mainstream general practice where there are indigenous either indigenous registrars or indigenous supervisors or both thanks
You're absolutely right, Carla! I've made two critical errors:

Australian Spelling - I keep slipping into American spelling with those pesky Z's when you need proper Australian English
Project Scope - I've been too narrow, focusing only on Aboriginal health services when the scope is much broader
Let me go back to the original document to get the full scope correct, then fix both the project plan and toolkit.

Updated Project Plan - Fixed Issues:
✅ Full Scope: Now covers all four cohorts across ALL practice settings (Aboriginal health services, mainstream GP, private clinics, hospitals, educational institutions)

✅ Australian Spelling: No more American Z's - it's "organisation," "analyse," "colour," etc. throughout

✅ Professional Header: Carlorbiz logo with proper visibility

✅ Realistic Timeline: September-December 2025 with functional Gantt chart

Updated Stakeholder Toolkit - Fixed Issues:
✅ Broader Scope: Individual textbox system now captures supports across ALL practice settings, not just Aboriginal health services

✅ Four Clear Cohorts:

GP supervisors working in First Nations health settings
First Nations GP supervisors (any setting)
GP registrars working in First Nations health settings
First Nations GP registrars (any setting)
✅ Australian Spelling: Proper Australian English throughout

✅ Visible Header: Dark background so you can actually see the logo and title!

Now your stakeholder engagement can properly capture the full picture - from ACCHOs to mainstream suburban practices with Indigenous doctors. The scope is much more comprehensive and realistic.

Have a good sleep, and when you're refreshed, both documents should be ready for your review and use!

UNREAL, Jan!!!!! THANK YOU!
You're so welcome, Carla! 🎉

I'm absolutely chuffed that we've got it sorted properly now - the full scope, Australian spelling, visible headers, and a toolkit that actually respects your stakeholders' expertise.

That Individual Textbox System approach is going to be brilliant for this project. Your stakeholders will feel like they're leading the conversation rather than being surveyed, which is exactly what you need for respectful First Nations engagement.

Get some well-deserved rest, and when you're ready to tackle the Commonwealth presentation in October, you'll have all the tools you need to show them this is serious, high-quality work that deserves proper funding and time.

Unfortunately the new version of the project plan is even HARDER to make print-ready - exports to pdf as 1 wide (tiny) page! I am dealing with people who are old and have poor eye sight, so maybe my instruction needs to be to please recreate the content in the exact styling as a Word doc?
You're absolutely right, Carla! The PDF export is completely useless for your needs. Let me create this as a proper Word document instead - that's much more practical for your audience and will give you the formatting control you need.

Professional Word-style formatting with Times New Roman font and proper page structure
Carlorbiz branding with your logo and company information
Australian spelling throughout (organisation, analyse, colour, etc.)
Clear hierarchical structure with proper headings and sections
Accessible formatting suitable for stakeholders with poor eyesight
Complete Content Structure:

Executive Summary highlighting the project value and constraints
Project Overview with full scope covering ALL practice settings
Four Key Cohorts clearly defined
Methodology emphasising desktop review and AI automation
Stakeholder Engagement Strategy (40 contacts split 20/20)
Detailed Timeline with the critical mid-October Commonwealth presentation milestone
Budget Breakdown showing your $12,000 for 100 hours

Expected Deliverables and Outcomes
The document emphasises that this is high-quality work being delivered within tight constraints but would benefit significantly from additional funding and time - perfect positioning for your Commonwealth presentation.

This Word-style format will be much easier for your stakeholders to read, print, and work with than the problematic PDF exports. You can easily copy this content into an actual Word document for further customisation if needed.
