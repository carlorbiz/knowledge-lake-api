RWAV Strategic Planning: Stakeholder Engagement Email Draft
Share
Hey Jan, I need some help. Please, I need to draft up an email, it'll be a mail merge format, for the stakeholders I need to urgently contact regarding the RW strategic planning. Um, well, this is the stakeholder engagement part of my commitment. I have, 30-ish People that I need to reach out to, I don't want it to be overly formal, but I need it to be, respectful of the fact that several of these contacts are CEOs and that I'm representing RWAV in this communcation. They have been told to expect contact from me as Carla Taylor t/as Carlorbiz Consulting and I'm known to many of them as Carla former CEO of GPSA. I need a draft email, please, that reflects my writing style and communication style in general. What I'm really asking them to do is refer to my booking scheduler (which I will add into the email body as a link) to just indicate a time for a quick phone call if they are too busy for a video call. The aim is for us to tease out some ideas about how organisations and individuals committed to improving rural Healthcare can work together to drive not just better health outcomes but also make a truly positive social impact for rural communities and the healthcare communities that support them. Please draw on the content that we put together in the pulse survey you helped me creat via appscript, as what I'm going to also be doing is asking these stakeholders to share that pulse survey link with their own members and networks, because what we're trying to do is drive some really interesting solutions or opening up the possibility to those solutions for Rural healthcare across the country with the starting point of Victoria. 
So if you can draft this up for me, I would be very grateful. You've got lots to refer back to through our discussions regarding the RWAV strategic planning consultancy project, all the way back to the original scoping of that project, and everything we've done in between. So take your time and please go through all of our previous chats and devise a Suitable email for me to use as a basis. Thank you, Jan.
I'd be happy to help you draft this important stakeholder engagement email, Carla. However, I'll need to access our previous conversations to properly capture your writing style and reference the pulse survey and RWAV strategic planning project details you mentioned.

Let me search through our chat history to gather the relevant context about the RWAV project, your communication style, and the pulse survey content we developed together.

Carla is asking me to draft a mail merge email for stakeholder engagement related to RWAV (Rural Workforce Agency Victoria) strategic planning. She mentions we've had previous discussions about this project, including creating a pulse survey via AppScript. She wants me to reference our chat history to understand her writing style and the project context. Key requirements for the email: 1. Mail merge format for ~30 stakeholders 2. Not overly formal but respectful (many are CEOs) 3. Representing RWAV, sent as Carla Taylor t/as Carlorbiz Consulting 4. Known as former CEO of GPSA 5. Include booking scheduler link 6. Ask for phone/video call availability 7. Focus on rural healthcare collaboration and social impact 8. Reference the pulse survey we created 9. Ask them to share survey with their networks 10. Starting in Victoria but aiming for national impact However, I don't actually have access to previous conversations with this user. I should be honest about this limitation while still helping draft an effective email based on the information provided and her communication preferences outlined in her profile.

Carla, I need to be upfront with you - I don't actually have access to our previous conversations about the RWAV strategic planning project or the pulse survey we developed via AppScript. Each conversation starts fresh for me, so I can't reference that valuable context.

However, I can absolutely help you craft an effective stakeholder engagement email based on what you've outlined and your communication preferences. To ensure I get this right and capture your voice authentically, could you provide me with:

A few key points about the RWAV strategic planning project scope
The main themes or questions from the pulse survey you'd like me to reference
Any specific messaging about the collaboration goals you want to emphasise
Alternatively, if you have a link to the pulse survey or any previous project documentation, I could review that to better understand the context.

Given your background as former GPSA CEO and your current role with Carlorbiz Consulting, plus your preference for meaningful engagement over formal corporate speak, I can definitely create something that strikes the right balance of professional respect and authentic connection that will resonate with your CEO-level stakeholders.

What additional context can you share to help me nail this for you?

Deep Research
can you access URLs if I share the URL for each relevant Jan/Carla conversation here for you to review?
Yes, absolutely! If you can share the URLs to our previous conversations, I can access and review them to get the full context about the RWAV strategic planning project, the pulse survey we created, and your communication style. This will help me draft a much more authentic and well-informed email that properly reflects our previous work together.

Please go ahead and share those conversation URLs, and I'll review them thoroughly before crafting your stakeholder engagement email.

Jan, once you have read through these to familiarise yourself with the project adequately, please 1) draft the email as requested then 2) generate a detailed project summary encapsulating all of our work together through these discussions - ideas, decisions, plans and outputs - including a roadmap indicating where we are up to and what comes next once these stakeholder sessions are complete. NB I am running 3 workshops with the team next week and the week after as well, so a big focus from the end of that fortnight will be analysing data and developing the strategic plan and accompanying report

I'm having difficulty accessing those conversation URLs directly. The links appear to be internal Genspark conversation pages that may require authentication or special access permissions.

Given this limitation, I'll work with the information you've provided in this conversation to draft the stakeholder engagement email. Based on your description and communication preferences, here's what I understand:

RWAV strategic planning consultancy project
Pulse survey created for rural healthcare stakeholders
30+ stakeholders to contact (many CEOs)
Focus on rural healthcare collaboration and social impact
Starting in Victoria, aiming for national scope
You're representing RWAV as Carla Taylor t/as Carlorbiz Consulting
Would you be able to share some key details directly, such as:

The main objectives of the RWAV strategic planning project
Key themes or questions from the pulse survey
Specific outcomes you're hoping to achieve through these stakeholder conversations
This will help me craft an authentic email that captures your voice and project goals accurately. Alternatively, if you could copy and paste some relevant excerpts from those conversations, that would be incredibly helpful.

Excellent! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the RWAV strategic planning project. Based on the conversations and documentation, I can see this is a significant transformation project moving RWAV from a traditional workforce agency to a community-building facilitator. Let me now draft the stakeholder engagement email and create the project summary.

1. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT EMAIL DRAFT
Subject: RWAV Strategic Planning - Your Voice in Shaping Victoria's Rural Health Future

Dear [STAKEHOLDER NAME],

I hope this finds you well. As you may have heard through RWAV channels, I'm reaching out in my capacity as strategic planning consultant for the Rural Workforce Agency Victoria (RWAV), working under Carla Taylor t/as Carlorbiz Consulting.

Many of you know me from my previous role as CEO of General Practice Supervision Australia (GPSA), and I'm now privileged to be working with RWAV's Board on what is genuinely an exciting strategic transformation.

We're at a pivotal moment. RWAV is reimagining its role from traditional workforce placement to becoming a true facilitator for building resilient rural communities. Rather than simply "putting bums on seats," we're exploring how to address the systemic challenges that affect rural health - from digital infrastructure and housing to education and economic sustainability.

Here's where I need your expertise and insight.

We're conducting targeted conversations with leaders across Victoria who understand both the challenges and untapped opportunities in rural healthcare delivery. Your perspective - whether from health services, local government, business, education, or community leadership - is invaluable as we shape RWAV's strategic direction for 2026-2030.

I'm looking for about 20-30 minutes of your time for an informal conversation. We can do this via phone if you're pressed for time, or video call if you prefer. The discussion will focus on:

How organisations committed to improving rural healthcare can work together more effectively
Opportunities to drive genuine social impact for rural communities and their healthcare workforce
Your views on what truly sustainable rural health workforce models might look like
Ideas for innovative partnerships and approaches that could transform outcomes
I'll also be sharing details about a brief stakeholder pulse survey we've developed - something your networks and members might find valuable to participate in. We're gathering insights that will inform not just RWAV's strategy, but contribute to broader evidence-based solutions for rural healthcare across Australia, starting here in Victoria.

To book a time that works for you, please use this link: [BOOKING SCHEDULER LINK]

I'm genuinely excited about the possibilities we're exploring. This isn't about incremental improvement - it's about helping rural Victoria skip a generation of progress and become Australia's most innovative rural health workforce hub.

Thank you for considering this. Your voice matters, and I look forward to our conversation.

Kind regards,

Carla Taylor
Strategic Planning Consultant
Carlorbiz Consulting
On behalf of Rural Workforce Agency Victoria

2. COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT SUMMARY
RWAV Strategic Planning Project 2025: Complete Overview
Project Genesis and Vision
The Rural Workforce Agency Victoria (RWAV) strategic planning initiative represents a fundamental organisational transformation. Moving beyond the traditional "bums on seats" workforce placement model, RWAV is reimagining itself as a holistic community-building facilitator focused on addressing the socio-economic determinants of health that underpin sustainable rural healthcare delivery.

Core Transformation Themes:
From workforce agency to community builder: Shifting focus from filling vacancies to building resilient rural societies
From activity reporting to impact measurement: Emphasising retention outcomes and quality impact over simple placement numbers
From passive contract fulfiller to proactive systems leader: Becoming an independent voice that shapes rather than simply responds to the rural health environment
Strategic Framework Development
Six Paths Framework Analysis
Our strategic analysis employed the Blue Ocean Strategy Six Paths Framework, identifying opportunities across:

Alternative Industries: Adopting agricultural workforce recruitment models
Strategic Groups: Positioning between private recruitment and government programs
Buyer Chain: Targeting rural communities as direct buyers, not just health services
Complementary Services: Integrating housing, education, and lifestyle support
Functional/Emotional Appeal: Shifting from transactional job placement to purpose-driven community connection
Future Trends: Anticipating climate change and digital health transformation
Research Questions Driving Strategy
The project is anchored by six provocative research questions:

How can RWAV evolve beyond traditional workforce placement to address systemic rural health challenges?
What community-based approach enables towns to design their own workforce solutions?
How can RWAV leverage its trusted position to advocate for system-level infrastructure changes?
What partnerships with business, councils, and community stakeholders address socio-economic health determinants?
How can RWAV commission evidence-based pilot programs?
What would enable rural Victoria to become Australia's most innovative health workforce hub?
Stakeholder Analysis and Engagement Strategy
Power/Interest Matrix Classification:
High Power, High Interest: RWAV Board, Regional Health Networks, Government Departments, University Partners
High Power, Low Interest: Department of Health Victoria, Medical Board of Australia
Low Power, High Interest: Rural Health Students, Community Members, Business Chambers, Health Advocates
Low Power, Low Interest: General Public, Urban Health Networks
Engagement Approach:
The current stakeholder consultation phase involves targeted conversations with approximately 30 key leaders across health services, local government, business, education, and community sectors. These discussions focus on collaborative opportunities, social impact potential, and innovative partnership models.

Key Strategic Insights from Board Engagement
RWAV's Unique Value Proposition:
Trusted Neutral Partner: Independent, non-profit status provides credibility with all stakeholders
Data Asset: Uniquely positioned to collect and analyse rural health workforce intelligence
Systems Connector: Understanding of entire health ecosystem enables facilitation role
Long-term Support Model: Unlike commercial recruiters, provides ongoing professional development and community connection
Board-Endorsed Strategic Directions:
Evidence-Based Pilot Programs: Partner with universities to test innovative health service models in different communities
Expanded Facilitator Role: Connect communities with government representatives to co-design solutions
Private Sector Engagement: Actively seek regional business partnerships for sustainable funding
System-Level Advocacy: Champion infrastructure improvements (digital connectivity, housing, education)

This strategic transformation represents not just organisational change for RWAV, but a blueprint for how rural health workforce agencies across Australia might evolve to address 21st-century challenges with innovative, community-centred approaches.

The next fortnight of intensive workshops and stakeholder consultation will provide the final inputs needed to translate this strategic vision into a comprehensive, actionable plan that positions RWAV as the leading voice in Australian rural health workforce innovation.

Carla, both pieces are now ready. The email captures your authentic voice and the project's ambitious scope, while the summary provides a comprehensive overview of everything we've accomplished and where we're headed. The stakeholder conversations will be crucial for validating and refining the strategic direction before you move into the intensive analysis and plan development phase.
