Jan, how do I explain "stakeholder journey stages" in the context of strategic planning involving a client's Board, team, partners and members of the public - specifically the staging described as Awareness > Engagement > Collaboration > Advocacy?
And advocacy? Does that relate just to the Board or does it imply integration of the organisation's objectives into the advocacy efforts of other stakeholders?
Carla, that's a brilliant strategic framework you're working with. Let me break down those stakeholder journey stages in the context of your multi-layered stakeholder ecosystem:

Awareness Stage This is where stakeholders first recognise your organisation exists and understand its basic purpose. For your Board, this might seem redundant, but it's actually about ensuring they grasp the full scope of strategic initiatives beyond their immediate governance focus. For team members, it's about understanding how their role connects to broader organisational objectives. Partners need to see where synergies exist, and the public needs to know you exist and what you stand for.

Engagement Stage Here's where stakeholders begin actively participating rather than passively receiving information. Board members move from rubber-stamping to genuine strategic input. Team members shift from task completion to proactive contribution. Partners start exploring collaborative opportunities, and members of the public begin interacting with your content, attending events, or providing feedback.

Collaboration Stage This is the sweet spot where stakeholders become co-creators rather than just recipients or participants. Board members champion initiatives beyond meetings, team members propose improvements and take ownership, partners actively co-design programs or services, and engaged public members might volunteer, provide testimonials, or help shape service delivery.

Advocacy Stage And here's where it gets particularly interesting for your strategic planning context. Advocacy doesn't just relate to the Board - it's the ultimate goal for all stakeholder categories, though it manifests differently:

Board advocacy: They become ambassadors in their professional networks, actively promoting the organisation's work and value proposition
Team advocacy: Staff become genuine believers who speak positively about the organisation even outside work contexts
Partner advocacy: They recommend your organisation to their networks and actively promote collaborative opportunities
Public advocacy: They become voluntary champions, recommending your services, defending your reputation, and potentially becoming formal ambassadors
The key insight is that advocacy represents the integration of your organisation's objectives into stakeholders' own advocacy efforts. When a Board member naturally weaves your organisation's achievements into their industry presentations, or when a partner proactively suggests your organisation to their clients, you've achieved true stakeholder advocacy.

This progression isn't always linear - some stakeholders might jump stages or regress - but it provides a useful framework for developing targeted strategies for each group at each stage.

Would you like me to explore how you might develop specific tactics for moving different stakeholder groups through these stages, particularly given your expertise in system mapping and strategic planning?

Excellent! Now I have the context I need. Let me develop specific stakeholder journey tactics for RWAV's 2026-2030 strategic planning, considering their unique ecosystem of health workforce support in rural Victoria.

Stakeholder Journey Tactics for RWAV's 2026-2030 Strategic Planning
Given RWAV's mission to address healthcare workforce shortages in rural Victoria, here's how you can apply the stakeholder journey framework across their diverse stakeholder ecosystem:

Board-Level Stakeholders
Awareness → Engagement

Tactic: Create quarterly "Strategic Context Briefings" that position individual agenda items within the broader 2026-2030 vision
Specific Application: Help board members see how immediate decisions about outreach programs or workforce grants connect to long-term rural health equity goals
Engagement → Collaboration

Tactic: Establish "Board Champion" roles where directors take ownership of specific strategic pillars (e.g., one champions Aboriginal health workforce, another champions allied health expansion)
Specific Application: Board members become genuine contributors to strategic initiatives rather than just governance oversight
Collaboration → Advocacy

Tactic: Develop "Board Ambassador Toolkit" with talking points and impact stories they can use in their professional networks
Specific Application: When Dr Morton speaks at RACGP events or Jane engages with legal/business communities, they naturally weave RWAV's achievements into their presentations
Team/Staff Stakeholders
Awareness → Engagement

Tactic: Monthly "Strategic Connection Sessions" where teams explore how their specific work contributes to the 2030 vision
Specific Application: Help Jo's recruitment team understand how their More Doctors for Rural Australia placements contribute to systemic change beyond individual positions filled
Engagement → Collaboration

Tactic: Cross-functional "Innovation Labs" where staff propose improvements to existing programs or entirely new approaches
Specific Application: Kate's grants team collaborating with Lauren's people and culture team to redesign professional development pathways that retain rural health professionals
Collaboration → Advocacy

Tactic: "Internal Influencer Network" where passionate staff become informal ambassadors at professional conferences and industry events
Specific Application: Staff naturally promoting RWAV's innovative approaches when networking with peers from other Rural Workforce Agencies
Partner Stakeholders (PHNs, Universities, Training Organisations)
Awareness → Engagement

Tactic: "Strategic Alignment Workshops" with key partners to map overlapping objectives and identify collaboration opportunities
Specific Application: Working with Murray PHN and Western Victoria PHN to understand how RWAV's 2030 vision complements their regional health strategies
Engagement → Collaboration

Tactic: "Co-Design Partnerships" for specific strategic initiatives, making partners genuine co-creators rather than just recipients of services
Specific Application: Collaborating with Monash and Deakin rural clinical schools to redesign student placement programs that serve both educational and workforce pipeline objectives
Collaboration → Advocacy

Tactic: "Success Story Syndication" where partners actively promote joint achievements in their own networks and publications
Specific Application: ACRRM or RACGP featuring RWAV partnership outcomes in their member communications
Public/Community Stakeholders (Rural Communities, Health Professionals)
Awareness → Engagement

Tactic: "Community Health Workforce Forums" that educate communities about workforce challenges while gathering their input on solutions
Specific Application: Regional forums where communities understand why their local GP shortage exists and how RWAV's strategies address systemic issues
Engagement → Collaboration

Tactic: "Community Champion Programs" where local health professionals and community leaders become active participants in workforce attraction and retention strategies
Specific Application: Local practice managers and community leaders helping to "sell" their regions to potential relocating health professionals
Collaboration → Advocacy

Tactic: "Grassroots Ambassador Network" where satisfied community members and health professionals actively recruit others and promote RWAV services
Specific Application: Rural GPs who've benefited from RWAV support becoming active recruiters at medical conferences and in professional networks
Cross-Cutting Strategic Considerations for 2026-2030
Integration Imperative: Your question about advocacy integrating organisational objectives into stakeholders' efforts is particularly astute. For RWAV, true advocacy means:

Board members naturally discussing rural health workforce solutions at industry events
Staff becoming thought leaders who shape national rural health workforce policy
Partner organisations prioritising RWAV collaboration in their own strategic plans
Communities viewing RWAV not as an external service provider but as an integral part of their health ecosystem
Measurement Framework: Track progression through journey stages using metrics like:

Awareness: Recognition surveys, unprompted awareness of RWAV services
Engagement: Participation rates in consultations, feedback quality
Collaboration: Co-created initiatives, shared resource commitments
Advocacy: Unprompted referrals, stakeholders promoting RWAV in their networks
The key insight for your strategic planning is that advocacy represents the point where RWAV's objectives become so aligned with stakeholders' own interests that they naturally champion your work without being asked - making your 2030 vision a shared ambition rather than RWAV's isolated goal.

Does this framework align with your strategic thinking, and would you like me to drill down into specific tactics for any particular stakeholder group?

This is great, Jan. Please can you develop some talking points on this I can use in my presentation / kickoff meeting with the RWAV Board in the morning? I have already primed them with "5 Big Questions" to whet their appetite and help them start articulating their vision in a way that will feed into this planning process. I would like to be able to explain the stakeholder journey stages to them as part of this kickoff - showing them that there is absolute value in them being involved throughout but also specifically as the bookends for this project as they need to start the engagement process and land on a concrete (but flexible) outcome that enables/delivers advocacy as you have described it so eloquently here

Perfect, Carla! Here are your talking points for the RWAV Board kickoff, weaving together the stakeholder journey framework with your five strategic challenge questions:

Talking Points: Board Kickoff - RWAV Strategic Planning 2026-2030
Opening Frame: Why the Stakeholder Journey Matters to Strategic Success
"Good morning, Directors. Before we dive into those five challenge questions I've posed, I want to establish why your role as Board members is absolutely critical - not just at the beginning and end of this process, but as the catalyst for transforming every relationship RWAV has.

The stakeholder journey framework - Awareness > Engagement > Collaboration > Advocacy - isn't just theory. It's how we turn your strategic vision into lived reality across Victoria's rural health ecosystem."

The Board's Dual Role: Participants AND Activators
Point 1: You're Not Just Governing This Process - You're Modelling It "As we work through questions like 'What if we became the catalyst that enabled rural communities to design their own workforce solutions?', you'll experience firsthand how stakeholders move from awareness to advocacy. Your journey through this planning process becomes the template for how we engage every other stakeholder group."

Point 2: Strategic Advocacy Starts Here "When we reach the advocacy stage of our journey today, you won't just approve a plan - you'll become its primary champions. The goal is that by December, when Dr Morton speaks at medical conferences or Jane engages with her legal networks, they're naturally weaving RWAV's 2030 vision into their conversations because it's become part of their own professional identity."

Connecting the Framework to Your Big Questions
Awareness to Engagement Bridge: "Your first challenge question about moving beyond the 'fill the vacancy' model - that's about shifting rural communities from passive awareness of RWAV services to active engagement with ecosystem-wide solutions. How do we help them see possibilities they didn't know existed?"

Engagement to Collaboration Bridge: "Your partnership power flip question is pure collaboration territory. You're asking: instead of stakeholders receiving our services, how do we make them co-creators of solutions? This is where communities, First Nations partners, and health professionals stop being clients and become genuine collaborators."

Collaboration to Advocacy Bridge: "Your leapfrog opportunity and influence game-changer questions? That's advocacy in action. When rural Victoria becomes Australia's most innovative health workforce hub, and when our policy influence becomes inevitable - that's because every stakeholder has made RWAV's success their own success."

The Bookend Imperative
Starting Strong: "Today's session launches the engagement process. Your willingness to wrestle with uncomfortable questions signals to every stakeholder that this isn't business as usual. You're demonstrating that RWAV leadership is prepared to be genuinely challenged and transformed."

Landing with Impact: "By December, we need a concrete but flexible outcome that enables advocacy. Not a document that sits on shelves, but a living strategy that becomes so compelling that stakeholders can't help but champion it. Your sustainability stress test question? That's advocacy thinking - when stakeholders find us so valuable they'd fund us themselves if government didn't."

The Strategic Conversation Framework for Today
Your Role in the Next 45 Minutes:

Think Beyond Incremental - Challenge the assumptions that have brought you this far
Embrace Discomfort - The questions are meant to stretch your thinking
Consider Relationships, Not Just Services - Every answer should consider stakeholder journey implications
Focus on Transformation, Not Just Improvement - How do we fundamentally change the game?
Key Prompt for Each Question: "As you consider each challenge question, ask yourself: How would this strategic choice move our key stakeholders - communities, health professionals, partners, government - from where they are now to becoming genuine advocates for rural health workforce transformation?"

The Advocacy Payoff
"When we achieve true stakeholder advocacy, here's what success looks like:

Rural communities actively recruiting health professionals to RWAV programs
Health professionals becoming unpaid ambassadors at conferences
Partner organisations prioritising RWAV collaboration in their own strategic plans
Government seeing RWAV as indispensable to their rural health objectives
That's not just strategic success - that's organisational sustainability built into the fabric of Victoria's rural health ecosystem."

Transition to the Five Questions
"With that framework in mind, let's explore how your five challenge questions can transform not just what RWAV does, but how every stakeholder experiences their relationship with rural health workforce solutions. Remember - today's discomfort is tomorrow's competitive advantage."

Closing Hook for Q&A: "The beauty of the stakeholder journey framework is that it's recursive. As stakeholders become advocates, they help move new stakeholders through the same journey. Your strategic choices today determine whether RWAV becomes a self-reinforcing catalyst for rural health transformation or remains dependent on constant external validation."

This positions you as both strategic consultant and change catalyst, while giving the Board a clear framework for understanding their ongoing role beyond governance. Good luck this morning!
