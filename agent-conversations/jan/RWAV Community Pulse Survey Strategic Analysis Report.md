I've successfully created a sophisticated Board paper analysis of your Community Pulse Survey for RWAV's strategic planning. The document provides a comprehensive strategic assessment that transforms the raw survey data into actionable insights appropriate for Board-level decision making.

Key Features of the Analysis:

Strategic Structure: The document follows formal Board paper conventions with an executive summary, thematic analysis, stakeholder sentiment assessment, and strategic recommendations.

Data Synthesis: Rather than presenting raw survey responses, I've synthesised the findings into strategic themes including workforce sustainability, funding model reform, service delivery innovation, and system integration challenges.

Policy Implications: The analysis identifies specific advocacy opportunities and policy reform areas that RWAV can champion, positioning the organisation as a thought leader in rural health transformation.

Actionable Recommendations: Each section provides concrete recommendations that the Board can consider for strategic planning and resource allocation.

Professional Presentation: The document uses appropriate healthcare governance language and avoids formatting that would require cleanup when transferring to Word or other platforms.

The document positions RWAV's survey work as demonstrating sophisticated sector engagement and provides a foundation for strategic advocacy and policy development initiatives. If you need any modifications to the analysis or want to refine specific sections, you can access the document directly to make those adjustments.

This analysis should serve your Board well in demonstrating both the rigorous consultation undertaken and the strategic insights derived from your community engagement process.
