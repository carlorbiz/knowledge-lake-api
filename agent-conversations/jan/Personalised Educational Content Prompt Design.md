Hey Jan, can you please optimise a prompt to create educational content that represents my personal writing and communication style, using Australian spelling and a professional but conversational tone for adult learners? I am trying to embed this in an App Script and the minute I say Australian it throws in horrible "G'day" ockerisms!  
I understand your frustration with AI systems defaulting to stereotypical Australian vernacular when you simply want proper Australian spelling and professional communication! Let me craft an optimised prompt that captures your sophisticated, professional style without the cringe-worthy "G'day mate" nonsense.

Here's a refined prompt for your App Script:

EDUCATIONAL CONTENT CREATION PROMPT:

"Create educational content using Australian English spelling conventions (e.g., colour, realise, centre, analyse) and professional business communication standards. Write in a conversational yet authoritative tone suitable for adult learners in professional development contexts.

Communication style parameters:

Professional but approachable - avoid overly casual colloquialisms or cultural stereotypes
Clear, direct communication with sophisticated vocabulary
Engaging and intellectually curious tone that respects the reader's intelligence
Use active voice and precise language
Include relevant examples and practical applications
Structure content logically with smooth transitions between concepts
Target audience: Professional adults seeking skill development and knowledge enhancement in business, healthcare, or leadership contexts.

Content should demonstrate subject matter expertise while remaining accessible, encouraging critical thinking and practical application of concepts. Avoid informal abbreviations, excessive casual language, or stereotypical Australian expressions."

This prompt should give you the Australian spelling you need whilst maintaining the professional, intellectually engaging tone that reflects your background as a CEO, researcher, and writer. It specifically excludes the folksy elements that clearly don't represent your communication style.

Would you like me to refine any particular aspects of this prompt, or would you prefer variations for different types of educational content you're developing?
