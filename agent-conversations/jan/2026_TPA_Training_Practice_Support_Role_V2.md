## Slide 2: Acknowledgement of Country

ACRRM acknowledges Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the custodians of the lands and waters where our members and staff work and live across Australia. We pay respect to their elders, lores, customs and Dreaming. We recognise these lands and waters have always been a place of teaching, learning, and healing.

## Slide 3: Your Role as TPA - Training Post Support

You are the support for the training post – some won't need a lot of assistance others will need their hand held constantly.

The site visit is a part of accreditation but it will give you the opportunity to learn about the post and to meet (most commonly virtually), if this hasn't happened previously.

**Know how to:**
- Support practices through accreditation and re-accreditation processes
- Guide Practice Managers on employment contracts, funding access, and reporting requirements
- Identify and escalate concerns early before they become larger issues
- Build strong, supportive relationships with training posts and supervisors

---

## Slide 4: Training Post Support Touchpoints Overview
