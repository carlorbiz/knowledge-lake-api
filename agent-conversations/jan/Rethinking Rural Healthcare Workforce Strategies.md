Please rewrite this with correct application of RWAV (mistakenly interpreted as "Our Way" in the transcript): # Strategic Planning Session for Regional Health: Rethinking GP Roles, Community Health Literacy, and Systemic Barriers

## Executive Summary

This strategic consultation convened a representative from the Regional Workforce Agency of Victoria ('Our Way') and Susan, an experienced rural General Practitioner, to explore innovative solutions for the challenges facing rural and regional healthcare. The discussion moved beyond simple workforce placement to address systemic issues. Key themes included the critical need to shift from a treatment-focused model to one centered on **prevention and patient responsibility**, the unsustainability of relying on International Medical Graduates (IMGs), and the necessity of redesigning the GP work environment to mitigate **cognitive and emotional overload**. The dialogue highlighted potential strategic roles for the 'Our Way' agency, such as becoming a service connector, monitoring community workforce stability, and leveraging its unique position in managing both locum and permanent placements to create flexible, long-term solutions. Major barriers identified include cumbersome administrative processes like Medicare provider numbers, misaligned funding models, and a widespread lack of community health literacy.

## Strategic Direction for 'Our Way' Agency

The discussion identified several key strategic opportunities for the 'Our Way' agency to drive meaningful social impact beyond traditional recruitment:

*   **Evolve into a Service Connector**: Act as a central hub or broker, connecting community members (e.g., a financially stressed farmer) with a network of appropriate health and support services, while maintaining a feedback loop to ensure care continuity.
*   **Promote Health Literacy**: Launch public awareness campaigns to educate the community on self-care, personal health responsibility, and the true costs and value of running a medical practice. This could help manage patient expectations and reduce aggression towards healthcare staff.
*   **Develop a Workforce Crisis 'Traffic Light System'**: Create a predictive system to identify and alert stakeholders when a community is at risk of a health workforce crisis, such as the impending retirement of a sole GP supervisor, allowing for proactive intervention.
*   **Champion Innovative Workforce Models**: Leverage its unique structure of managing both locum and permanent placements to facilitate portfolio careers. This allows doctors to combine permanent part-time work with locum shifts, providing flexibility that can improve retention and service coverage.
*   **Facilitate True Team-Based Care**: Help design and template effective multi-disciplinary care models that are genuinely supportive of GPs, rather than simply adding to their administrative and clinical risk burden.

## Key Challenges in Rural & Regional Health

Several fundamental challenges were identified as root causes of the current crisis in rural and regional healthcare:

*   **Unsustainable Workforce Models**: An over-reliance on IMGs who often do not remain in communities long-term was deemed unethical and ineffective. The system is not successfully growing its own workforce from local communities.
*   **GP Burnout and Attrition**: The primary driver of GPs reducing their hours is not financial but the immense, underappreciated **cognitive and emotional load** of the job. This leads to practices closing as partners retire without successors.
*   **Systemic Disincentives**: The current fee-for-service model works against collaborative, team-based care, and isolates GPs, making the profession less attractive compared to the collegial environment of hospitals.
*   **Practical Barriers**: A critical shortage of affordable **accommodation** in regional areas presents a major obstacle to attracting and retaining all types of health professionals.
*   **Low Community Aspiration**: A cultural issue was noted where authority figures in regional towns, like school counselors, actively discourage local students from pursuing ambitious careers like medicine.

## Proposed Solutions & Innovations

The conversation generated several actionable ideas to reform the healthcare landscape:

*   **Prioritize Prevention**: Fundamentally shift the focus of the health system from reactive treatment to proactive prevention, empowering individuals with the knowledge and tools for self-care.
*   **Create Portfolio Careers for GPs**: Develop and value non-clinical roles (e.g., medical education, supervision, policy work) that GPs can undertake alongside their clinical duties. This provides respite from the high-stress clinical environment and helps retain their expertise within the health system.
*   **Reintroduce Collaborative Team Meetings**: Implement structured, multi-disciplinary team meetings involving GPs, allied health, and other professionals to collaboratively manage complex patients, share the clinical load, and provide mutual support.
*   **Innovate Locum Usage**: Move beyond using locums as temporary fillers. Instead, foster a model of 'frequent flyer' locums who return regularly to the same community to provide continuity of care and can be integrated into quality assurance and training.
*   **Establish Hub-and-Spoke Models**: Facilitate models where GPs based in a central 'hub' can provide services on a regular, rotational basis to smaller 'spoke' communities, ensuring consistent access to care.

## The Role and Wellbeing of General Practitioners

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the sustainability of the GP profession:

*   **Cognitive and Emotional Load**: It was established that approximately **30 clinical hours per week** appears to be the maximum sustainable load for a GP due to the high cognitive demands of the role. Any strategy to increase clinical capacity must address this reality.
*   **Attractiveness of the Profession**: The central question for the future is: "How do you turn general practice into something that tomorrow's GPs want to work full-time in?" This requires addressing issues of professional isolation, burnout, and business viability.
*   **The Partnership Model is Failing**: The traditional model of practice ownership is becoming increasingly unattractive, with fewer GPs willing to take on the financial and administrative burdens of partnership, leading to practice closures.

## Patient & Community Engagement

Improving the community's role in the healthcare system was a critical theme:

*   **The 'Consumer' Mentality**: The shift to viewing patients as 'consumers' has created an expectation of immediate service and entitlement, disconnected from any sense of personal responsibility for one's own health.
*   **Devaluation of Services**: The perception that healthcare is 'free' (due to bulk-billing) has led to a devaluation of the service and, in some cases, abuse of the system (e.g., demanding home visits for non-urgent issues).
*   **Patient's Role in Healthcare**: A cultural shift is needed to re-establish that patients have both rights and responsibilities. They need to be empowered as active participants and advocates in their own healthcare journey.

## Systemic & Structural Barriers

System-level impediments to effective healthcare delivery were analyzed:

*   **Medicare Provider Number Delays**: The waiting period of several weeks to obtain a new Medicare provider number was identified as a "silly" but significant barrier. It impedes workforce mobility, causes income loss for doctors, and delays care for communities, especially when a registrar needs to move practices quickly.
*   **Flawed Funding Models**: The fee-for-service model discourages holistic care, while some PHN-led multi-disciplinary team models are poorly designed, placing all clinical risk and uncompensated coordination time on the GP.
*   **The NHS Is Not a Panacea**: Both participants agreed that simply adopting a state-funded model like the UK's NHS is not the answer, as it brings its own severe problems with access, bureaucracy, and system abuse.

## Key Insights & Takeaways

*   **Address Cognitive Load to Increase Capacity**: To increase GP service capacity, the focus must be on reducing cognitive overload through team support and portfolio careers, not just demanding more hours.
*   **Value is Tied to Cost Awareness**: Making the community aware of the real costs of healthcare is essential for fostering respect, encouraging responsibility, and reducing system abuse.
*   **Administrative Streamlining is Crucial**: Removing simple administrative barriers, like automating the provider number process, could yield significant improvements in workforce flexibility and efficiency.
*   **'Our Way's' Unique Advantage**: The agency's integrated approach to locum and permanent recruitment is a powerful, underutilized asset that can be strategically deployed to build a more resilient rural workforce.
