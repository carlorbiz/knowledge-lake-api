Hello, and welcome. Today, we’re exploring a topic that… well, it sits at the very heart of building a strong and diverse healthcare system here in Australia. I'm talking about the supervision and support of International Medical Graduates, or, you know, IMGs. These doctors are such an essential part of our medical community. I mean, they make up about a third of our entire workforce. So when an IMG registrar joins your practice, it’s this amazing opportunity for mutual growth. But, of course, it also presents its own unique set of challenges. In this podcast, we'll walk through six core principles that can help you, as a supervisor and as a practice team, create a really supportive environment where your IMG registrar can… can truly thrive.
So, let's begin with the first two principles. They're very closely linked: **Avoid Generalisations** and **Identify Differences, Not Deficits**. It’s just so important to remember that IMGs are not… not a homogenous group. Each doctor arrives with a completely unique combination of knowledge, skills, and life experiences. And when a challenge comes up, it’s… it's so easy to just label it a ‘cultural’ or a ‘language’ issue. But effective supervision, well, it means digging a little deeper. It means you have to specifically ‘diagnose’ the problem – is it educational, is it personal, or is it even systemic?
And at the same time, we have to focus on difference, not deficit. Your registrar brings this… this wealth of positive attributes. You know, maybe it’s fluency in other languages, or experience in completely different health systems, or just a really high degree of resilience. Acknowledging those strengths is every bit as important as identifying the learning needs.
To make this a bit more tangible, let’s consider a case study. Let's meet David. He's a 38-year-old GP registrar, and he was a specialist ophthalmologist back in China. He’s just started his first GP term in a rural town, but his wife and his two young kids are four hours away in the city. So his supervisor, Maria, she notices that while David is clinically really sharp, he seems… hesitant, especially during consultations about preventative health. And he’s also confided in her that he’s missing his family terribly. Now… if Maria were to just generalise, she might think, 'Oh, okay, his hesitation is a 'cultural issue' around patient-centred communication.' But by applying our first two principles, she can look at other possibilities. You know, is David simply unfamiliar with Australian preventative health guidelines? Is all that stress of being away from his family affecting his confidence? And Maria can also actively identify his strengths. She can tell him she’s really looking forward to his expert input on eye presentations. See? It positions him as a valuable colleague, not just a trainee with deficits.
This brings us right to our third principle: **Expect the Need for Broad Support**. Look, the transition into general practice can be tough for any registrar, but for an IMG, it’s often layered with these extra challenges of navigating a new country, a new healthcare system, and… and just personal settlement. As a supervisor, your role is really broad. It’s educational, yes, but it’s also pastoral, personal, and professional. In David’s case, his homesickness is a huge barrier. So, Maria’s support here is crucial. It might just be checking in on his well-being, or maybe suggesting telehealth options so he can connect with his own GP, or... just being a listening ear. It's vital to be really overt about this supportive role, so your registrar knows they can come to you with more than just clinical questions.
Next, let's talk about principle four: **Foster a Culture of Learning and Feedback**. Creating an open, honest, and safe environment is really the bedrock of effective teaching. We have to remember that in many cultures, direct critique can be misunderstood as a sign of serious failure, or it can cause a 'loss of face'. So, to maintain that mutual respect, it’s a great idea to agree on a process for frank and supportive feedback right from the get-go. For Maria, this means she has to approach that conversation about David’s consultation style with care. Instead of just saying, “You need to be more direct,” she could frame it as a core part of her teaching. She might say something like, “You know, in Australian general practice, patients tend to respond really well to a certain style of communication about preventative health. It’s a skill we can work on together, and I’m here to help you develop it.” See how that frames the feedback as supportive development? Not a criticism.
Okay, our fifth principle is to **Provide a Comprehensive Orientation**. And this is a big one. A good orientation at the start of a term is an absolute cornerstone of success. It’s been shown to boost an IMG’s sense of professional identity, their morale, and their sense of belonging. And this goes way beyond the standard clinical and admin intros. It should include a discussion of Australian culture, and that includes the history and culture of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It’s also incredibly helpful to provide information on local community supports, and… and where you can, to include an orientation for the registrar’s partner and family. A strong start can prevent so many downstream issues.
And finally, our sixth and final principle: **Engage Assistance Early**. Supervisors, you are not expected to manage complex issues all on your own. Performance concerns can be multifaceted, and you have support. Please, have a low threshold for seeking guidance from the registrar’s medical educator or your regional training organisation. In Maria’s situation, if she felt David’s issues were getting beyond the scope of her support, reaching out early is the most effective and responsible thing she could do.
So, to recap, our six principles are: Avoid Generalisations, Identify Differences not Deficits, Expect the Need for Broad Support, Foster a Culture of Feedback, Provide a Comprehensive Orientation, and Engage Assistance Early. By embedding these principles into your daily interactions, you create this… this educational alliance that's built on respect and understanding. And this doesn’t just help your registrar thrive, it enriches your entire practice and, ultimately, it leads to better health outcomes for the community you serve.
Now, as we close, I have a question for you to reflect on. Think about an IMG you are currently supervising, or maybe one you have supervised in the past. Choose one of the six principles we talked about today. How could applying that one principle more intentionally have changed… or how could it still change, your supervisory approach and the learning experience for that registrar?
Take a moment to capture your response. You can write it down, type it into a digital note. Store this reflection somewhere safe, so that in the coming weeks and months, after you put these learnings into practice, you can come back to it and add your new insights. Thank you for listening.
