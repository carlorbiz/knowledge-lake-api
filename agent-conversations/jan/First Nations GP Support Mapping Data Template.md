Share
Created by super agent
Create a multi-sheet Google Sheets template for analysing First Nations GP Support Mapping data with the following structure:

**Sheet 1: Raw Data Import**
- Columns for all toolkit data fields including:
  * Timestamp and submission ID
  * Respondent details (organisation, role, region)
  * Supervisor supports (existing, gaps, cultural factors)
  * Registrar supports (training contexts, cultural needs)
  * Regional factors and community-specific requirements
  * Critical gaps identified and improvement opportunities
- Data validation rules and formatting
- Automated duplicate detection

**Sheet 2: Regional Analysis Dashboard**
- Pivot tables summarising data by Australian states/territories
- Charts showing support distribution across regions
- Gap analysis by geographic area
- Rural vs metropolitan comparison metrics
- Population demographics integration where available

**Sheet 3: Cultural Factors Analysis**
- Thematic categorisation of cultural considerations
- Word cloud data preparation for cultural themes
- Community-specific needs aggregation
- Cultural competency gap identification
- Traditional Owner engagement tracking

**Sheet 4: Stakeholder Cohort Comparison**
- Comparative analysis across four key cohorts:
  * GP Supervisors in First Nations Settings
  * First Nations GP Supervisors (Any Setting)  
  * GP Registrars in First Nations Settings
  * First Nations GP Registrars (Any Setting)
- Support availability matrix
- Training needs assessment by cohort

**Sheet 5: Executive Summary**
- Key metrics dashboard for board reporting
- Automated summary statistics
- Priority gaps ranking
- Implementation readiness assessment
- ROI projections for intervention programs

**Sheet 6: Action Planning**

- Progress monitoring framework

Include formulas for automated calculations, conditional formatting for data quality alerts, and embedded charts ready for executive presentations. Ensure all sheets include appropriate headers, instructions, and data protection settings.
I'll create a comprehensive Google Sheets template for analyzing First Nations GP Support Mapping data with all the requested sheets and functionality.
