I notice you didn't use my Carlorbiz logo as requested and you have used the genspark document formatting which is not suited to A4 with footer and header allowance. Can you fix this?
You're absolutely right! Let me fix the document to use your Carlorbiz logo and proper A4 formatting with header and footer allowances. I'll also remove the unnecessary Genspark/Pico CSS styling.

Please use my actual logo attached - the page remains continuous and will not transfer readily to properly formatted - are you able to match the configuration of an A4 page with 10mm header and footer margins?
Perfect! Thank you for providing your actual Carlorbiz logo. I can see it's a beautiful design with the green text and the distinctive leaf quill element. Let me update the document with your proper logo and fix the A4 formatting with the correct 10mm header/footer margins.

Perfect! I've updated the document with:

Your actual Carlorbiz logo - Now using the beautiful green logo with the distinctive leaf quill design

Proper A4 formatting with 10mm header/footer margins:

A4 page size (21cm × 29.7cm)
10mm (1cm) top and bottom margins for header/footer space
Standard 25.4mm (2.54cm) left and right margins
Proper page break handling
Enhanced logo sizing - Made it slightly larger (200px) to better showcase your professional branding

The document now has proper A4 proportions with the correct header/footer margin allowances and your actual Carlorbiz branding. This should format much better for printing and transfer to Word/PDF while maintaining the professional appearance with your distinctive logo.

The formatting maintains all your template specifications:

11pt Arial font
0pt before paragraph, 6pt after paragraph
H1/H2/H3 heading hierarchy
Left alignment
Professional business document structure

can you reduce the left/right margins as this is not working at all - I wwill spend more time fixing what you generate than doing it myself, and I don't have time for either!
You're absolutely right - let me fix this immediately with much narrower margins that will actually work properly for A4.

Done! I've reduced the margins significantly:

Left/Right margins: Now 15mm (1.5cm) instead of 25.4mm
Top/Bottom margins: Kept at 10mm (1cm) for header/footer space
Body width: Now responsive with max-width 18cm instead of fixed 21cm
Removed unnecessary page-break settings that were causing issues
This should format much better for A4 and actually be usable without requiring extensive fixes. The content will now fit properly on the page width.
