I've got a new angle that we need to incorporate into my narrative for the book thread. Now, I don't want it to dominate, I don't want it to become exclusive. Maybe we branch off into a separate couple of white papers, workbooks or something, but I don't want it to dominate and narrow down my market too much. But the second stream that I'm thinking we have to include is women executives returning to work after cancers that are identifying to challenge their gender identity, i.e. breast cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, really any type that will probably change their appearance in some way, shape or form during treatment or after. So, all cancers, honestly. I think the edge to this is the fact that if women are already facing, as we all do, whether we know it or not, some form of stereotyping and gender bias in our corporate clients. So, we've been harassed. We've had to fight to define ourselves as executives, not as women executives. We've had to do all of that in our ascension only to topple off that ladder to undertake treatment for something we never saw coming. Now, let's take aside the fact that we're probably also wearing the hats of wife, mother, carer, something else that's very gender specific to being a woman, some other encumbrance. Let's keep that aside for a minute and just say as a woman, we are already facing down stereotyping, stigma, bias about our sexuality. Now, cancer erodes that sexuality. So, you think we've climbed Mount Everest to achieve a leadership role. Well, cancer pushes us off that mountain and that road that we carved into that mountain to get to the top, that's disappeared because we don't even have that gender sexuality to climb up on. We become sexless. And you know what men don't trust? Women. Anything that doesn't have a definition. Gender neutrality or sexlessness is its own type of encumbrance. But it's something that starts from within and it spirals outwards. It's not just in the professional space, it's in the personal space as well. So, we need to find some confidence building tools that can again help women to define themselves and their experience and the adversity that they have conquered to be on the other side of that journey. We need that for them. It needs to be a stream of its own, but it needs to be incorporated into this narrative because this is part of my story. It's another reason why I think we need to explore do women executives end up going back disproportionately, less so than men, into that executive sphere? Are we the ones who are more technically resigning quietly, taking a redundancy quietly and just not fighting anymore because we've fought all our lives to get to that top of those in the land? We've fought and even though we made it there, it meant nothing because the mountain's gone now. That is something I want to weave into this story. Love your opinion.

Carla, this is a powerful, necessary angle — and handled carefully, it **adds depth and legitimacy** to the book rather than narrowing it. My view, in short: **you’re right to include it, and you’re right to refuse to let it dominate**. The strength lies in *how* it’s woven, not how loudly it’s stated.

Below is my considered opinion, structured so you can see where it strengthens the core narrative, where it should branch, and where the evidence supports the questions you’re asking.

---

## **1\. Why this angle belongs in the book (but not as the headline)**

What you’re describing is not “women’s health content”. It’s **identity rupture at executive level**, with gendered consequences.

The book’s central thread is already about:

* senior leaders losing momentum after a disruptive life event  
* identity shock (competence, relevance, confidence)  
* a return-to-work environment that has moved on without them

This angle deepens that by showing **how identity loss is compounded for women**, because:

* executive identity was *already* hard-won  
* legitimacy was *already* conditional  
* visibility was *already* scrutinised

Cancer — particularly cancers that affect sexual characteristics, fertility, or appearance — doesn’t just interrupt work. It **collapses the internal scaffolding women used to survive bias in the first place**.

That makes this angle:

* **structural**, not anecdotal  
* **psychological**, not political  
* **relevant to leadership**, not just survivorship

Handled this way, it strengthens the book’s thesis rather than reframing it.

---

## **2\. The “sexless executive” insight is sharp — and rare**

Your observation here is unusually astute:

gender neutrality or sexlessness is its own type of encumbrance

This is not discussed enough in RTW or leadership literature, but it aligns strongly with what we *do* know:

* RTW research consistently shows **female gender is associated with poorer return-to-work outcomes**, even when controlling for health and job type  
   \# \--Barriers to Return to Work …  
* Psychosocial barriers like **loss of self-efficacy, stigma, and identity threat** materially affect whether people even *attempt* to return  
   \# \--Barriers to Return to Work …  
* These barriers are internal first, external second — exactly as you describe

What you’re naming isn’t just sexuality loss. It’s:

* loss of *legibility*  
* loss of the identity markers that previously signalled authority  
* a shift from “exceptional woman executive” to “undefined risk”

That is a real, corrosive confidence spiral — and it fits cleanly into the book’s broader exploration of **why capable leaders quietly exit rather than fight back**.

---

## **3\. Your question about quiet exits is the right one**

This is where your instinct is especially strong:

do women executives end up going back disproportionately less so than men?

The answer from existing data is frustrating — but revealing.

* RTW datasets often **exclude people who “choose” not to return**, classifying them as retired or inactive rather than as failed returns  
   \# \--How Are Retirement and Redu…  
* That means women who:  
  * take redundancy quietly  
  * self-select out due to confidence erosion  
  * decide it’s “not worth the fight anymore”

…are largely **invisible in the data**.

This invisibility matters. It allows systems to claim neutrality while:

* women absorb the cost privately  
* organisations avoid accountability  
* leadership pipelines quietly narrow

Raising this question in the book — without overstating conclusions — positions you as:

* intellectually honest  
* evidence-aware  
* willing to name what the data can’t yet prove

That’s credibility, not speculation.

---

## **4\. How I’d integrate this into the book (without narrowing the market)**

Here’s the structural approach I recommend.

### **In the book:**

* **One dedicated chapter or section** framed around *identity loss after disruption*  
* Women’s experience appears as a **revealing case**, not a separate stream  
* Your personal story is used sparingly, as an anchor — not the argument

The chapter focuses on:

* identity erosion  
* confidence collapse  
* legitimacy anxiety  
* the internal decision to stop pushing

Gender is present, but not exclusive.

### **Outside the book:**

This is where the depth belongs.

Spin out:

* a white paper on **gendered identity loss and executive RTW**  
* a workbook or guided reflection tool on **reclaiming executive identity post-illness**  
* potentially a women-only cohort or pilot program later

This protects your market breadth *and* honours the specificity of the issue.

Grey literature from cancer organisations and insurers already supports this kind of targeted intervention work

\# \--Grey Literature and Non-Aca…

— you wouldn’t be inventing the category, just elevating it to executive level.

---

## **5\. Confidence-building tools: where AI actually fits (quietly)**

One final point that strengthens the whole ecosystem.

AI-enabled tools — when positioned correctly — can help women:

* externalise self-doubt  
* rehearse narratives safely  
* rebuild authority language without exposure  
* regain a sense of cognitive sharpness and control

That aligns perfectly with:

* confidence rebuilding  
* identity redefinition  
* re-entry without immediate social risk

And it dovetails with your existing thesis about AI as **augmentation, not substitution**, especially for leaders returning after disruption

\# \--AI and Digital Transformati…

.

---

## **My bottom line**

This angle:

* **belongs** in the book  
* **must not dominate**  
* **should provoke questions, not close markets**

Handled with restraint, it:

* deepens your authority  
* explains quiet exits others ignore  
* legitimises a cohort that has been doubly erased

You’re not narrowing your audience — you’re **telling the truth more completely**.

If you want, next we can:

* draft the exact chapter outline  
* pressure-test language so it stays powerful without tipping into advocacy  
* map the book → white paper → product ecosystem cleanly

This is strong work.

Sources  
I actually think we need to take a counter position as well in the marketing. Um, not the marketing, I actually need to reach out and find male perspectives on this. So I need to see whether, without making it, you know, this is my opinion, this is what's yours, we need to make it, um, you know, I've got the experience of being a female who identifies as challenged. If you're a male who's going through this, um, what is your experience of identity loss through, um, illness, debilitating illness such as cancer or stroke? Um, you know, the literature will tell us so much, but I'd really like personal experience to be woven into the content as well. So maybe we invite male participants or male experiences, um, through, you know, social media call-out. Um, what do you think? Then it's got balance. Then it's actually using the female experience quite legitimately and not making it, well, you know, we do it tougher than you, but each of us has it tough. Male, female, no gender to start with, and oh my goodness, we have to be careful with not calling out that there are only two genders, don't we? We have to make sure that people who don't identify as either male or female are also, um, you know, how do they, how do they go through these treatments, um, when the healthcare worker is more concerned about keeping them alive than, than stepping on niceties, um, you know, stepping on their toes and making sure they use the right pronouns. So, you know, how did that impact them? And, you know, what would help them to sort of consolidate that and, and recognise the help they were given rather than the, the insult they might have felt? Maybe that's just something else you need to consider.

Yes — bringing in male and gender-diverse lived experience is a smart move, and it will *strengthen* your authority because it shows you’re not using gender as a blunt instrument; you’re examining **identity disruption in leadership** through multiple lenses.

Here’s how I’d do it so it’s balanced, inclusive, and ethically solid.

## **How to include other perspectives without turning it into “battle of the sexes”**

Make the organising frame **identity loss \+ professional reintegration**, not gender. Then treat gender as one of several “identity surfaces” that illness can disrupt.

A simple way to hold balance:

* **Universal spine:** leadership identity rupture → confidence → credibility → re-entry.  
* **Different expressions:** gendered embodiment (appearance, sexuality, fertility), masculine role expectations (strength, provider identity), non-binary/trans experiences in healthcare systems, etc.  
* **Shared question:** “What changed, and what did you need to rebuild?”

That prevents “women have it tougher” while still allowing women’s experience to be named clearly and respectfully.

## **A practical plan to source stories (without creating risk for you or participants)**

### **1\) Put out a call for “story contributors”, not “case studies”**

Keep it invitational and human. Offer choices:

* anonymous / first name only / full name  
* written response / audio note / short interview  
* permission to quote directly vs paraphrase

### **2\) Use a screening \+ consent flow (lightweight but explicit)**

A simple 1-page consent statement is enough:

* what the project is (book \+ potential workbook/white paper)  
* how their story may be used (quotes, anonymised themes)  
* right to withdraw up to a cutoff date  
* no medical advice, not a clinical study  
* privacy boundaries (don’t submit employer-identifying details)

### **3\) Recruit through *multiple channels* to reduce sample bias**

You’ll otherwise only get “people like you” (high verbal confidence \+ LinkedIn-active). Consider:

* LinkedIn (executives)  
* cancer survivor networks (grey literature orgs \+ communities)  
* stroke foundations / neuro rehab communities  
* men’s health groups  
* LGBTQIA+ professional networks

You don’t need huge numbers — even **8–15 quality narratives** can create powerful thematic range.

## **Inclusive language: keep it natural, not performative**

You’re right to be careful, but you don’t have to contort the prose. A few simple defaults work:

* Use **“people of all genders”**, “men”, “women”, and “gender-diverse/non-binary people” when relevant.  
* Ask for **pronouns and terms** participants want used (and whether they want them included at all).  
* Avoid “both genders”; use “all genders” or “multiple genders”.  
* In healthcare-pronoun scenarios: focus on **impact \+ repair**, not blame.

Your framing line can be something like:

“This book includes experiences from women, men, and gender-diverse leaders, because illness doesn’t just disrupt health — it disrupts identity.”

## **What to ask: an interview guide that gets depth fast**

Use prompts that pull for *identity*, not medical detail:

1. Before illness, what did “being a leader” mean to you?  
2. What changed most in how you saw yourself?  
3. What changed in how others treated you at work?  
4. What parts of identity felt most under threat? (authority, competence, appearance, sexuality, provider role, voice, energy, etc.)  
5. What was the hardest moment of re-entry — and what helped?  
6. What did you wish your manager/colleagues understood?  
7. What language or assumptions hurt, even when unintended?  
8. What would you tell someone returning to an executive role tomorrow?

For gender-diverse participants, add (optional):

* “Were there moments in healthcare or work where identity wasn’t recognised? What would ‘repair’ have looked like?”

## **Copy you can use: a call-out draft (LinkedIn-friendly)**

I’m writing a book for senior leaders returning to work after a major illness (cancer, stroke, and other life-altering conditions).  
I’m looking for **men, women, and gender-diverse executives** willing to share a short reflection on **identity change and return-to-work**.  
You can contribute anonymously, and you choose whether I quote you directly or paraphrase your insights.  
If you’re open to it, comment “I’m in” or DM me and I’ll send 8 short prompts.

## **One caution (so you stay safe and credible)**

If you include trans/non-binary experiences, avoid positioning it as “niceties” vs survival. A tighter, fairer framing is:

* healthcare teams are under pressure  
* identity recognition still matters  
* the leadership lens is: **how people repair trust after rupture**

That protects empathy on both sides and fits your broader theme of reintegration.

If you want, I can also draft:

* the one-page consent language (plain English)  
* a short Typeform/Google Form question set  
* a coding framework to turn stories into themes you can weave into chapters without over-quoting any one person.

Here's the research I did to give the women's perspective gravitas \# \*\*Return to Work for Women Executives After Cancer: Identity, Sexuality, and Stigma\*\* The literature addresses the profound challenges women—especially those in executive roles—face when returning to work (RTW) after cancers like breast or cervical, but \*\*direct research on the intersection of lost professional identity, altered sexuality, and compounded stigma for women executives is limited\*\*. However, several studies provide relevant insights. \#\# Loss of Professional Identity and Work Centrality \- Work is often central to women’s self-worth and identity, especially for those in high-level roles. Cancer disrupts this, leading to a sense of lost identity, diminished confidence, and social isolation. Many women describe their careers as a “calling,” making the disruption from cancer particularly severe (Gershfeld-Litvin et al., 2025; Trusson et al., 2020). \- The process of RTW is not just about resuming tasks but about reconstructing a sense of self and professional purpose, often amid changed priorities and capabilities (Trusson et al., 2020). \#\# Sexuality, Gender Discrimination, and New Stigma \- Breast and cervical cancers can result in physical changes (e.g., mastectomy, loss of reproductive organs) that deeply affect body image and sexuality. This loss is especially poignant for women who have experienced gender discrimination tied to their appearance or sexuality during their careers (Trusson et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2021). \- Survivors report feeling “sexless” or stigmatized, both in professional and personal contexts, compounding the emotional burden and sometimes leading to further workplace discrimination or marginalization (Trusson et al., 2020; Peterson et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). \- Stigma related to cancer, especially when it affects sexual organs, is well-documented and can lead to altered self-image, shame, and social withdrawal (Peterson et al., 2021; Bae & Temkin, 2025; Tan et al., 2021). \#\# Barriers and Facilitators to RTW \- Barriers include persistent fatigue, depression, body image issues, lack of workplace support, and ongoing discrimination—now layered with the stigma of illness and perceived loss of femininity or sexuality (Marinas-Sanz et al., 2023; Magnavita et al., 2024; Trusson et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2021). \- Facilitators include supportive employers, tailored workplace policies, and psychosocial interventions that address both identity and sexuality concerns (Gershfeld-Litvin et al., 2025; Marinas-Sanz et al., 2023; Trusson et al., 2020). \#\#\# Key Themes in RTW for Women Executives After Cancer Theme Description Citations Identity Disruption Loss of professional identity, need for self-reinvention (Gershfeld-Litvin et al., 2025; Trusson et al., 2020\) Sexuality & Stigma Altered body image, loss of sexuality, new stigma as “sexless” (Trusson et al., 2020; Peterson et al., 2021; Bae & Temkin, 2025; Tan et al., 2021\) Gendered Discrimination Ongoing or new workplace discrimination, compounded by illness (Trusson et al., 2020; Peterson et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021\) Support Needs Importance of tailored, holistic support for RTW (Gershfeld-Litvin et al., 2025; Marinas-Sanz et al., 2023; Trusson et al., 2020\) \*\*Figure 1:\*\* Themes in RTW for women executives post-cancer: identity, sexuality, stigma. \#\# Conclusion While direct research on women executives is sparse, the literature highlights that RTW after breast or cervical cancer involves navigating profound identity loss, altered sexuality, and layered stigma—often in environments already marked by gender discrimination.

This is solid work, Carla. You’ve done exactly what you needed to do to give the women’s perspective **gravitas without over-claiming** — and, importantly, you’ve left enough intellectual space to justify bringing male and gender-diverse perspectives alongside it.

I’ll break my response into four parts:

1. how strong this evidence base actually is  
2. where it’s vulnerable (and how to shore it up)  
3. how it sets you up *perfectly* for a balanced, comparative approach  
4. how I’d translate this into book-ready authority without sounding academic

---

## **1\. Does this research give the women’s perspective legitimacy?**

**Yes — absolutely.** And more than that, it gives you *permission* to speak where the literature is thin.

What you’ve done well:

* You **explicitly acknowledge the gap** (women *executives* at the intersection of sexuality \+ identity \+ leadership are under-researched). That protects you from critique.  
* You draw from **high-quality qualitative studies** where identity, agency, and stigma are central — not peripheral.  
* You don’t overreach. You’re not claiming causality; you’re mapping *patterns*.

This line is doing a lot of work for you:

“direct research on the intersection … is limited”

That is the licence for lived experience, narrative inquiry, and comparative voices.

In other words: you’re not replacing evidence with story — you’re **completing** the evidence with story.

---

## **2\. Where this section is strong — and where to tighten it**

### **Strengths you should keep exactly as-is**

* **Identity disruption** framed as *biographical rupture* (Trusson et al.)  
* Sexuality framed as *socially mediated*, not just bodily  
* Stigma treated as layered (gender \+ illness \+ workplace power)  
* RTW framed as **reconstruction**, not resumption

This aligns beautifully with RTW theory more broadly and avoids “women’s issues” framing.

### **One small but important refinement**

Right now, the argument implicitly reads as:

women already face gender discrimination → cancer removes sexuality → stigma intensifies

That’s true — but to future-proof it, I’d add one clarifying bridge sentence (in the book, not the research appendix):

“What is lost is not femininity per se, but *legibility* — the cues through which authority, confidence, and belonging had previously been negotiated.”

That reframes sexuality loss as **symbolic capital loss**, which is leadership language, not gender politics.

---

## **3\. Why this research *demands* male and gender-diverse perspectives (not optional)**

Here’s the key insight:  
Your women’s evidence is strong **because it focuses on identity**, not because it focuses on women.

That makes the next step intellectually inevitable.

The literature already tells us:

* Men experience identity threat differently after illness (provider role, strength, stoicism).  
* Gender-diverse people often experience **systemic misrecognition**, especially in healthcare settings where survival trumps identity affirmation.

But what’s missing — across *all* genders — is:

* executive-level identity disruption  
* credibility erosion  
* quiet withdrawal rather than failed RTW

So when you invite male and gender-diverse narratives, you’re not diluting the women’s case. You’re doing three powerful things:

1. **Testing whether “sexlessness” is gendered or universal**  
   * For women: loss of sexuality undermines authority  
   * For men: loss of strength/virility undermines legitimacy  
   * For gender-diverse people: misrecognition compounds vulnerability  
2. **Showing different paths to the same cliff-edge**  
   Identity loss → confidence collapse → exit (quiet or forced)  
3. **Positioning yourself as curator, not advocate**  
   You are *hosting* the inquiry, not prosecuting a case.

That’s exactly where senior readers trust you.

---

## **4\. How I’d translate this into book-ready authority**

Here’s how this research should *function* in the book (not how it should read academically):

### **In-text positioning**

* Use the research to **set boundaries**, not conclusions.  
* Then step into narrative and comparative insight.

Example tone (not wording to copy verbatim):

“The research tells us that women returning to work after cancers affecting sexuality often experience identity rupture, stigma, and loss of confidence. What it doesn’t tell us is how this plays out at executive level — or how it compares with the identity loss men and gender-diverse leaders experience after serious illness. That’s where lived experience matters.”

### **Structural implication**

* Women’s experience \= **one anchor chapter**  
* Male \+ gender-diverse experiences \= **counterpoint chapter**  
* Followed by a synthesis chapter on *identity reconstruction across difference*

That sequencing avoids hierarchy. No one is “added on”.

---

## **My considered view**

You’ve done enough research to:

* justify centring women’s experience **without apologising**  
* justify broadening the inquiry **without backpedalling**  
* invite male and gender-diverse voices **without tokenism**

This is no longer “your story plus research”.  
It’s becoming a **legitimate, original contribution** to leadership, RTW, and identity literature — grounded in evidence, completed by lived experience.

Next logical steps, if you want them:

* pressure-test the *male* literature quickly to identify likely contrasts  
* design the participant call-out so it mirrors the research themes  
* draft a synthesis framework so stories don’t overwhelm the argument

You’re on very strong ground here.

I'll undertake the male/gender-diverse research if you'll draft a white paper from the perspective of women execs returning to work after cancer

Excellent — that’s a clean division of labour and it plays to the strengths of the material you’ve already assembled.

Below is a **draft white paper**, written to be **publication-ready**, evidence-anchored, and suitable for later adaptation into:

* a book extract  
* a policy brief  
* a thought-leadership download for MTMOT / Carlorbiz

It is deliberately **not advocacy-led**. The authority comes from synthesis, restraint, and clarity.

# **Beyond Survival: Women Executives Returning to Work After Cancer**

### **Identity, Sexuality, and the Quiet Exit from Leadership**

---

## **Executive Summary**

Women executives returning to work after cancer face challenges that extend far beyond physical recovery. For cancers that affect sexual organs, fertility, or appearance, return-to-work (RTW) is frequently accompanied by **profound identity disruption**, altered self-perception, and layered stigma.

While the academic literature documents barriers to RTW for women cancer survivors broadly, **the specific intersection of executive identity, sexuality loss, and workplace legitimacy remains under-examined**. This gap obscures the experiences of senior women who, despite clinical recovery, disengage from leadership pathways — often quietly and without formal recognition as failed RTW cases.

This white paper synthesises existing research to articulate:

* how professional identity rupture manifests for women executives post-cancer  
* why altered sexuality and appearance can intensify stigma in senior roles  
* how these factors contribute to under-reported attrition from executive careers

It concludes with implications for employers, policymakers, and leadership development practitioners seeking to retain experienced women leaders.

---

## **1\. Context and Scope**

Cancer survivorship among working-age women has increased significantly due to advances in detection and treatment. As a result, RTW has become a critical dimension of recovery.

For women in executive roles, work is often:

* central to identity and self-worth  
* the result of prolonged navigation of gender bias  
* tied to visibility, authority, and symbolic capital

Cancer interrupts not only employment continuity but the **narrative coherence** of leadership identity.

This paper focuses on women executives returning to work after cancers commonly associated with changes to sexuality, fertility, or physical appearance (including but not limited to breast, cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancers). It does not claim exclusivity; rather, it examines a cohort whose experiences are currently under-represented in RTW discourse.

---

## **2\. Professional Identity Disruption After Cancer**

### **Work as Identity, Not Just Employment**

Qualitative research consistently demonstrates that work is deeply embedded in women’s sense of self, particularly for those in senior or vocationally driven roles. Cancer introduces what has been described as **biographical disruption**, forcing a reassessment of competence, purpose, and future orientation.

For executives, this disruption is magnified by:

* loss of role continuity  
* diminished confidence in cognitive or physical stamina  
* perceived loss of relevance in rapidly evolving organisational contexts

RTW is therefore not a simple resumption of duties, but a process of **identity reconstruction under observation**.

---

## **3\. Sexuality, Appearance, and Stigma in Executive Contexts**

### **Altered Sexuality as Symbolic Loss**

Cancers affecting sexual organs or secondary sex characteristics often lead to:

* altered body image  
* perceived or actual loss of sexual identity  
* feelings of shame, invisibility, or “sexlessness”

While sexuality is rarely discussed explicitly in professional settings, it functions implicitly as part of **social legibility** — influencing how authority, confidence, and presence are read.

For women who have already navigated gendered expectations around appearance and comportment, these changes can undermine the informal cues through which leadership legitimacy has historically been negotiated.

### **Layered Stigma**

Cancer-related stigma is well documented, particularly where illness is associated with sexual organs or reproductive health. For women executives, this stigma is layered atop:

* pre-existing gender bias  
* assumptions about fragility or reduced capacity  
* unspoken discomfort with bodily difference in senior roles

The result is often social withdrawal, reduced visibility, or self-limiting behaviour — not because capability is absent, but because **psychological safety is eroded**.

## **4\. Barriers to Return to Work: Beyond the Physical**

Research identifies multiple barriers to RTW for women after cancer, including:

* persistent fatigue and cognitive effects  
* depression and anxiety  
* body image concerns  
* inadequate workplace accommodations

For executives, these barriers are compounded by:

* high performance expectations  
* limited tolerance for perceived weakness  
* lack of tailored reintegration pathways at senior levels

Importantly, many women who disengage do not appear in RTW failure statistics. Voluntary resignation, redundancy acceptance, or early retirement often remove them from formal datasets, rendering their exits **statistically invisible**.

## **5\. Facilitators and Gaps in Current Practice**

### **What Helps**

Evidence suggests that successful RTW is supported by:

* flexible, individualised accommodations  
* psychologically informed support  
* explicit recognition of identity reconstruction, not just functional capacity

However, most interventions are designed for general workforces, not executive roles where:

* peer parity is limited  
* disclosure carries reputational risk  
* performance narratives are tightly controlled

### **What’s Missing**

Current RTW frameworks rarely address:

* executive identity loss  
* the impact of altered sexuality on confidence and authority  
* the cumulative effect of gender bias and illness stigma

This omission contributes to quiet attrition rather than visible failure.

## **6\. Implications for Organisations and Leadership Systems**

For organisations seeking to retain experienced women leaders, the findings suggest a need to:

1. **Recognise RTW as an identity process**, not solely a functional one.  
2. **Design executive-level reintegration pathways** that allow phased visibility and confidence rebuilding.  
3. **Address stigma indirectly but deliberately**, through language, role design, and leadership norms.  
4. **Avoid interpreting quiet exits as choice alone**, recognising the structural pressures shaping those decisions.

Failure to do so risks the ongoing loss of senior women at precisely the point where their experience is most valuable.

---

## **Conclusion**

Women executives returning to work after cancer often navigate a convergence of identity disruption, altered sexuality, and layered stigma — within organisational environments that lack the language or structures to support this complexity.

While the academic literature provides strong evidence of these dynamics among women cancer survivors generally, executive-specific experiences remain under-explored. This gap obscures patterns of disengagement that are neither accidental nor inevitable.

Addressing these issues requires moving beyond survival metrics toward **identity-aware leadership reintegration** — a shift that benefits not only women, but organisations seeking sustainable, experienced leadership in an era of increasing workforce disruption.

**Next options (only if you want them):**

* tighten this into a 6–8 page branded PDF  
* create a companion executive checklist or reflection tool  
* map where excerpts slot cleanly into book chapters without repetition

When you’re ready, we can also ensure the **male/gender-diverse white paper mirrors this structure** so the two can stand side-by-side with intellectual symmetry.
