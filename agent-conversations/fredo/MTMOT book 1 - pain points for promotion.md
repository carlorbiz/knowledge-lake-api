What would you say are the 5 key pain points we're addressing with this book that I should be highlighting in promotional materials?

Here are **five core pain points** the book tackles—distilled from the research you’ve assembled and the lived executive-level realities you’re writing for. These are framed to work powerfully in promotional material and tie directly to the evidence base across RTW, executive learning, digital transformation, and post-illness career disruption.

## **1\. The hidden complexity of returning to work after illness or crisis**

Executives rarely anticipate the sheer mix of **health, cognitive, psychological, and workplace barriers** that accompany a return to senior roles after cancer, major illness, or prolonged caregiving. The research shows these barriers are layered, interacting, and often underestimated—even by high-performing leaders

**Why it matters for promotion:**  
Position the book as the first to map this complexity in plain language, making an overwhelming landscape navigable.

## **2\. The loss of professional confidence, identity and perceived relevance**

RTW studies consistently highlight **self-efficacy collapse, stigma (internal and external), and fear of no longer being “enough.”** Executives returning after a health hiatus face an especially pronounced gap between who they were and who the workplace now expects them to be

**Why it matters for promotion:**  
This pain point speaks directly to the quiet shame and self-doubt that experienced leaders rarely admit but always feel.

## **3\. The rapid acceleration of digital and AI capability requirements**

Senior roles have changed dramatically in a short period. Digital transformation has shifted leadership expectations, introduced new technical fluencies, and heightened the pressure to “catch up fast.” The learning curve is steep; many executives fear their experience has aged faster than they have

**Why it matters for promotion:**  
This frames the book as a bridge—helping seasoned leaders reclaim authority in a world that now demands AI fluency.

## **4\. The lack of tailored support for high-level professionals returning after illness**

Despite abundant RTW literature, **almost none** is designed for senior executives. Corporate RTW processes tend to focus on general workforce needs, not the unique pressures of roles involving governance, strategic oversight, stakeholder visibility, and high-stakes decision-making. Grey literature confirms the gap between policy guidance and lived experience, particularly for cancer survivors and those managing long-term conditions

**Why it matters for promotion:**  
You can legitimately position this book as addressing a *massive, unserved niche*.

## **5\. The silent drift toward retirement or exit—often framed as “choice” but driven by systemic barriers**

RTW data shows many executives disappear from the workforce not because they truly want to retire, but because the pathway back feels impossible. However, because voluntary retirement is classified separately in RTW datasets, this group is largely invisible—its struggles uncounted and unaddressed

**Why it matters for promotion:**  
This reframes the problem as structural, not personal—helping readers feel understood rather than inadequate.

## **In short, the book promises to solve:**

1. **Overwhelm.**  
2. **Identity disruption.**  
3. **AI-driven skill gaps.**  
4. **Absence of executive-specific RTW guidance.**  
5. **Unseen pressures pushing leaders out of the workforce entirely.**

If you’d like, I can now craft **taglines, audience-specific messaging**, or **a promotional narrative** that blends these pain points into compelling marketing copy.
