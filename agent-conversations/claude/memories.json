She operates three organizations: CARLORBIZ (consulting, WordPress, apps), MTMOT (coaching, memoir, MakeTheMostOfToday.com), and GPSA/HPSA (medical education). The project has been in development for approximately one month and involves complex technical integration work requiring continuity across multiple conversations and sessions.\n\n***Active workstreams & initiatives***\n- Building and refining the AAE Docker MCP architecture, with existing mem0 implementation running locally on a Waitress server\n- Integration work involving a custom MCP bridge that was implemented by external collaborators\n- Technical documentation and architecture refinement based on working implementations rather than theoretical designs\n- Addressing technical continuity challenges when working across multiple conversation sessions\n\n***Project methods & patterns***\nCarla has established specific quality and formatting standards:\n- Exclusive use of Australian spelling conventions\n- Visual content created only through Gamma app (no AI image generation)\n- Document formatting standardized to A4 specifications\n- PowerPoint presentations following specific formatting requirements\n- Preference for building upon existing working implementations rather than starting from theoretical frameworks\n- Expects seamless project context continuity across sessions as a paying customer\n\n***Tools & resources***\n- Docker for containerization architecture\n- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI system integration\n- mem0 running locally on Waitress server with custom MCP bridge\n- Gamma app for visual content creation\n- Claude Projects environment for maintaining technical project continuity", "0199bebe-e116-7780-bea1-7bd0e67649c0": "**Purpose & context**\n\nCarla is developing a comprehensive GP Training Practice Management Course consisting of 9 modules for Australian healthcare administrative professionals, specifically practice managers working within the Australian general practice training system. The course covers critical areas from practice preparation and NTCER employment standards to cultural diversity and medical student placements. This work is being done for her client GPSA, with tight project timelines requiring collaboration with colleagues Jan and Fred.\n\nThe project operates within Australia's evolving GP training landscape, requiring strict compliance with current standards including NTCER Version 2025.2, the college-led training model under RACGP and ACRRM, and the National Consistent Payments Framework 2025. Carla demonstrates deep expertise in Australian healthcare training systems and maintains rigorous attention to regulatory accuracy, including corrections for obsolete Regional Training Organisation references that have transitioned to College-Led Training.\n\nSuccess is measured by creating premium educational content that works seamlessly with Absorb LMS while maintaining user control and transparency. Carla emphasizes that clients will abandon systems after three failed attempts if they're not intuitive, driving her focus on balancing sophisticated AI automation with strategic manual intervention points.\n\n**Current state**\n\nCarla has successfully transitioned from a complex n8n workflow to a streamlined Google Apps Script-based automation system for course creation. All 9 modules have been generated through her Module Content Generator, with comprehensive content including research foundations, slide content, assessments, and role-play scenarios. The system integrates Google Sheets, Gemini API, and various output formats optimized for Absorb LMS compatibility.\n\nShe's currently working through the final implementation phase, focusing on converting generated content into \"copy-paste-ready\" build specifications that minimize manual entry time in Absorb Create AI. Recent work has involved troubleshooting assessment format compatibility, ensuring exactly 5 simplified assessment types per module, and addressing technical challenges with LMS content parsing and slide structure recognition.\n\nA critical ongoing challenge involves Absorb LMS automatically converting Australian spelling to US spelling despite explicit input formatting, requiring various workaround strategies and potential system configuration changes.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nUser control and transparency are paramount - sophisticated automation must include strategic manual intervention points, particularly around research quality and content review. Carla has learned that separating Audio generation from Module content generation gives users better control over slide content before audio creation.\n\nAustralian regulatory compliance requires constant vigilance as the training landscape evolves rapidly. Content must reflect current 2025-2026 structures including college-led training models, updated NTCER provisions, and proper terminology (avoiding obsolete RTO references).\n\nAssessment design benefits from variety over complexity - exactly 5 simplified assessment types work better than complex branching scenarios, which are too time-consuming to implement effectively. The focus should be on engagement through drag-and-drop, fill-in-the-blank, and sequencing questions rather than elaborate branching logic.\n\nEvidence-based content generation using hybrid human-AI workflows maintains quality while achieving efficiency. The combination of NotebookLM for internal sources and Gems for web research creates reliable foundation material for course development.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nCarla follows a sophisticated 8-phase workflow: research foundation development, course architecture creation, content generation, assessment design, interactive media development, LMS formatting, quality review, and deployment. Each module requires 2500-3500 word research foundations with Vancouver citations, followed by structured content generation producing exactly 12 slides with 150-225 word voiceover scripts.\n\nContent development emphasizes Australian context throughout, including proper pronunciation guides (ACRRM as \"Ackr'm\", \"data\" as \"dahta\") and sophisticated accent instructions blending American, Western European, and British influences while avoiding stereotypical pronunciations.\n\nThe system uses strategic separation of concerns - different workbooks handle different functions, with IMPORTRANGE functionality linking components while maintaining modularity. Quality control involves systematic verification of content preservation across all development stages.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nThe core technical stack centers on Google Apps Script integrated with Gemini API, Google Sheets for project management, and Google Drive for content storage. The system uses rclone for backup management and PowerShell for automation tasks.\n\nFor LMS deployment, the workflow integrates with Absorb LMS and Absorb Create AI, with specific formatting requirements for content parsing. iSpring Suite Max capabilities inform assessment design constraints, though the focus has shifted toward native Absorb LMS functionality.\n\nKey regulatory frameworks referenced include RACGP and ACRRM standards, AHPRA requirements, NTCER 2025.2 provisions, and the National Consistent Payments Framework. The system maintains current Australian healthcare training documentation and Department of Health AGPT program information.\n\nContent development relies on Vancouver citation standards, Australian spelling enforcement, and specific phonetic replacement systems for text-to-speech optimization while preserving professional terminology in display content.", "01997948-2a48-710a-a410-7ae5857be61f": "**Purpose & context**\n\nCarla operates professional development businesses including GPSA (healthcare) and Carlorbiz/MTMOT (executive education), creating evidence-based courses for Australian healthcare professionals and C-suite executives globally. Her primary objective is building a sophisticated AI-powered course generation ecosystem that transforms user-provided concepts and source materials into complete, SCORM-compliant professional development courses. The system must meet Australian regulatory standards including AHPRA compliance and professional development requirements, with mandatory Australian spelling and Vancouver citation style throughout.\n\nThe project emerged from critical limitations in her existing Google Apps Script system, which was experiencing crashes, quota limits, and reliability issues when generating comprehensive healthcare courses. Success means delivering a robust, automated system that produces complete course packages including slide presentations, professional Australian voiceovers, interactive assessments, and LMS-ready content without the maintenance burden of the previous implementation.\n\nKey collaborators include her AI Automation Ecosystem (AAE) with multiple AI agents coordinated through Notion databases, and DPSSA as a client organization requiring independent operation capabilities. The system serves healthcare professionals supervising International Medical Graduates (IMGs) and executive audiences, requiring sophisticated audience-specific content generation with evidence-based research foundations.\n\n**Current state**\n\nCarla has successfully implemented the Research Foundation pipeline using Perplexity AI to analyze source URLs and create comprehensive research documents based on peer-reviewed sources. The multi-agent n8n workflow architecture is actively being developed with specialized agents handling different aspects: research synthesis, course recommendations, module content creation, slide generation, voiceover scripts, audio production, assessments, and final delivery.\n\nRecent technical breakthroughs include resolving Google API authentication issues by implementing Google Service Account credentials, creating a dynamic prompt library web service deployed on Vercel, and establishing the Google Form \u2192 Google Sheets \u2192 Notion \u2192 n8n workflow for professional user experience. The system now processes user submissions through branded forms and delivers results via professional email notifications with three delivery options: Express, Quality Control, and Staged Delivery.\n\nCurrent challenges being navigated include Google Drive folder access permissions with service accounts, JSON escaping issues in n8n HTTP Request nodes (resolved by switching to Code nodes), and ensuring AI agents can properly access generated Google Docs through authentication and sharing permissions.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nThe complete course generation pipeline is being finalized with remaining agents for SCORM packaging, interactive assessments using Reveal.js framework, and comprehensive complementary assets including workbooks and implementation checklists. Integration with the Knowledge Lake API system is being explored to enable enhanced multi-agent collaboration through centralized knowledge management and cross-agent learning capabilities.\n\nFuture considerations include expanding TTS options with Speechify Studio API for personal courses using cloned voice capabilities, implementing Google Cloud TTS for role play characters with cartoon avatars, and potentially integrating Notion 3.0's new AI agents and webhook features for reduced external dependencies.\n\nThe system architecture will support four audience types (Executive, Healthcare Clinical, Healthcare Administrative, Healthcare Combined) with sophisticated prompt management through the Notion AI Prompts Database containing audience-specific prompts and dynamic placeholders.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nEvidence-based content generation is non-negotiable - the system must analyze substantial peer-reviewed sources before generating course recommendations rather than relying on AI hallucination. The Research Foundation stage analyzing 20-30 sources has proven essential for meeting Australian regulatory standards and professional credibility requirements.\n\nStaged processing approaches are more reliable than attempting simultaneous processing of all course components, addressing realistic concerns about API rate limits and system reliability. The workflow separation into individual functions (research, content generation, slide creation, audio generation, email delivery) has proven more robust than monolithic processing.\n\nGoogle Service Account authentication eliminates token refresh issues that would make the system unmarketable for business use, though it requires understanding that shared folders appear in \"Shared with me\" rather than \"My Drive\" from the service account's perspective. Professional Australian voiceover quality requires Gemini API with custom pronunciation guides rather than basic Google Text-to-Speech, which produces inadequate robotic output.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nThe workflow follows a sophisticated multi-agent parallel processing architecture coordinated through Notion database triggers. Course concepts enter via Google Forms, trigger n8n workflows through Google Sheets integration, and progress through specialized AI agents with specific roles and outputs. Each agent accesses dynamic prompts from the Vercel-hosted API, ensuring consistent audience-specific content generation.\n\nContent creation maintains a 70/30 practical-to-theory ratio with mandatory \"---\" slide delineation for external AI parsing and LMS upload compatibility. The system uses Code nodes for content cleaning with regex patterns to handle JSON escaping issues, and implements proper delay mechanisms between API calls to avoid quota limitations.\n\nQuality control is built into the delivery options, allowing module-by-module user approval or automated staged delivery. The email-based synthesis workflow provides better security and audit trails compared to direct API access, with conversation summaries formatted for automated Notion database population through the AAE system.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nThe core technology stack includes n8n workflow automation running on Docker Desktop, Notion databases for coordination and tracking, Google Workspace ecosystem (Forms, Sheets, Docs, Drive) for user interaction and file management, and Vercel for hosting the dynamic prompt library API. AI integrations span multiple services: Perplexity AI for research foundation with web browsing capabilities, Claude Sonnet for content generation, and Gemini API 2.5 for professional Australian text-to-speech.\n\nThe Notion workspace contains interconnected databases (Course Concepts, Module Development, Slide Development, Assessment Development) with specific relation field mappings and the AI Prompts Database storing audience-specific prompts with dynamic placeholders. Google Service Account credentials provide reliable authentication for automated document creation and sharing.\n\nThe prompt library system contains sophisticated Australian healthcare specifications including pronunciation guides, AHPRA/RACGP/ACRRM compliance requirements, and professional development frameworks. The system integrates with external tools for SCORM packaging and interactive assessment creation using Reveal.js framework for LMS compatibility.", "0198932d-c1e3-71f0-9543-d05b85a405b7": "**Purpose & context**\n\nCarla is building an \"AI Knowledge Synthesis Empire\" - a revolutionary multi-agent memory sharing system designed to capture conversations from different AI agents (Fred/ChatGPT, Claude, Jan, Penny, Colin, Pete, Gemini, NotebookLM) and intelligently route insights to Notion for cross-pollination and knowledge synthesis. This system serves multiple businesses: GPSA/HPSA (medical education), CARLORBIZ (consulting), and MTMOT (coaching). The ultimate vision includes scaling to a memoir podcast with multi-content automation featuring TTS integration, WordPress pipeline integration, and GitHub app management. Success is measured by creating a unified, evolving knowledge base where AI agents learn from each other's conversations, enabling cross-business insights and automated content generation.\n\n**Current state**\n\nCarla has made a strategic pivot from Make.com webhook-based automation to a pure MCP-powered architecture after encountering persistent integration issues. The foundation is solid with a complete Notion database architecture including the \"Smarter Not Harder\" project integration and Fred Tasks Database.

The architectural integrity has been verified and confirmed ready for scaling across the multi-business ecosystem.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nThe roadmap focuses on four key phases: completing the MCP OpenMemory foundation, implementing AI agent specialization across business domains, developing the revolutionary content pipeline with TTS integration using Vertex AI and Speechify Studio, and achieving full business empire integration. Plans include expanding the system to integrate WordPress and GitHub pipelines, with the memoir podcast serving as a flagship demonstration of the multi-content automation capabilities.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nCarla has learned that webhook-based integrations create unreliable dependencies and has pivoted to MCP-native architecture for better control and stability. The \"Smarter Not Harder\" addition to the Notion workspace enhances rather than breaks existing structure, creating valuable cross-pollination opportunities between business automation and productivity domains. Architectural integrity and field naming consistency are critical for successful MCP integration pathways. The system's value lies in enabling AI agents to learn from each other's conversations rather than operating in isolation.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nWork is organized around systematic architectural development with careful attention to database schema consistency and integration pathways. Problem-solving involves thorough validation of architectural changes before implementation, with emphasis on maintaining cross-pollination capabilities between different business domains. The approach prioritizes API-driven automation over webhook dependencies, focusing on direct AI-to-database connections and intelligent routing logic for knowledge synthesis.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nCore infrastructure includes Notion databases with specific field structures, OpenMemory MCP for cross-platform memory sharing, and a multi-AI agent ecosystem spanning ChatGPT, Claude, and various specialized agents.
