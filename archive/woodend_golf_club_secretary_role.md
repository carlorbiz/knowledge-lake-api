**Date:** November 24, 2025

## Executive Summary

This document provides a practical interpretation of the Secretary and Board Director role at Woodend Golf Club, based on the comprehensive handover notes from the previous Secretary. The role encompasses administrative management, member services, regulatory compliance, stakeholder coordination, and board governance responsibilities.

## Core Responsibilities Overview

The Secretary and Board Director position at Woodend Golf Club is a multifaceted volunteer role that serves as the administrative backbone of the organization. The position requires managing 16 key functional areas, coordinating with multiple stakeholders, and ensuring regulatory compliance across various government and industry bodies.

## Detailed Functional Areas

### 1. Club Email Management

**Primary Responsibility:** Central communication hub management

**Key Details:**
- **Email:** woodendgolfclub@gmail.com
- **Password:** Woodend3442!!
- **Function:** Serves as the primary contact point for all club communications, member inquiries, booking requests, and external stakeholder correspondence

**Practical Interpretation:** This is the nerve center of club operations. The Secretary must monitor this inbox regularly (ideally daily) to ensure timely responses to membership applications, booking requests, maintenance issues, and general inquiries. Effective email management directly impacts member satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### 2. Membership Renewals and Applications

**Primary Responsibility:** Member lifecycle management from application to renewal

**Key Systems:**
- **MiClub Database:** https://woodend.1golf.com.au/security/login.msp
  - Username: Admin4
  - Password: Woodend3442!
- **Google Sheets:** Membership tracking spreadsheet (accessible via club email)

**Process Flow:**
1. Receive membership application via email
2. Process payment
3. Add member information to Excel spreadsheet
4. Enter member data into MiClub database
5. Email new member fact sheet and R&A Guide to new member

**Practical Interpretation:** This is a critical member-facing function that creates the first impression for new members. The Secretary must balance administrative accuracy (ensuring all databases are updated) with timely, welcoming communication. The dual-system approach (Excel + MiClub) suggests a transitional state, with MiMembership potentially streamlining this in the future. Priority should be given to learning the MiMembership system to improve efficiency.

**Key Documents:**
- New Member Fact Sheet (attached in handover)
- R&A Guide (The Rules of Golf Etiquette & Behaviour on the Course)
- Membership Application Form (2025-26)

### 3. Green Fee Bookings and Cart Hire

**Primary Responsibility:** Coordinate casual play bookings and equipment rental

**Key Systems:**
- **Google Calendar:** Booking schedule management
- **Cart Hire Form:** Physical form kept behind bar for staff use

**Process Flow:**
1. Receive booking request via woodendgolfclub@gmail.com
2. Liaise with Grant and Drew to confirm cart availability
3. Confirm booking with customer
4. Ensure staff record booking in Google Calendar

**Practical Interpretation:** This function requires real-time coordination between the Secretary, maintenance staff (Grant), and other administrators (Drew). The Secretary acts as a booking coordinator, ensuring that customer requests align with operational capacity. The reliance on staff to manually record bookings suggests potential for process improvement through automated booking systems.

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Grant (maintenance/cart management)
- Drew (administrative support)
- Bar staff (booking form management)

### 4. Board Meetings

**Primary Responsibility:** Board governance and meeting administration

**Key Requirements:**

- **Management Platform:** MyCommittee
  - URL: https://app.mycommittee.com/Account/Login
  - Email: woodendgolfclub@gmail.com
  - Password: Woodend3442!

**Practical Interpretation:** As Secretary and Board Director, this is a dual role. The Secretary is responsible for the administrative aspects (scheduling, agenda preparation, minute-taking, document distribution), while as a Board Director, active participation in strategic decision-making is expected. The MyCommittee platform should be used to streamline paper management, ensuring all board members have access to meeting materials in advance.

**Best Practices:**
- Schedule meetings well in advance (quarterly or bi-monthly)
- Circulate agenda and supporting documents at least one week before meetings
- Take comprehensive minutes and distribute within one week of meeting
- Maintain action item tracking between meetings

### 5. Google Drive and Club Members

**Primary Responsibility:** Document management and member database maintenance

**Key Systems:**
- **Google Drive:** Accessible via club email (woodendgolfclub@gmail.com)
- **Google Sheets:** Membership tracking (parallel to MiClub)

**Key Tasks:**
- Track expiring introductory offer memberships
- Send renewal reminders with payment amounts
- Maintain document repository for club operations

**Practical Interpretation:** This function involves proactive member retention through timely renewal reminders. The Secretary must monitor membership expiry dates and communicate with members before their memberships lapse. The dual-tracking system (Google Sheets + MiClub) requires diligent cross-checking to ensure data consistency.

### 6. Communications

**Primary Responsibility:** Member communication coordination

**Key Systems:**
- **Social Media:** Managed by Matt Payne and Michelle Jakovac
- **Newsletter:** MiClub newsletter function

**Practical Interpretation:** While social media is delegated to others, the Secretary retains responsibility for formal member communications through the MiClub newsletter system. This is an opportunity to keep members informed about club news, upcoming events, policy changes, and community updates. Regular communication (monthly or quarterly newsletters) helps build member engagement and community.

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Matt Payne (social media)
- Michelle Jakovac (social media)

### 7. Consumer Affairs Victoria

**Primary Responsibility:** Regulatory compliance for incorporated associations

**Key Systems:**
- **URL:** https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/mycav/dashboard
- **Password:** Woodend3442!

**Key Requirements:**
- Update Secretary, Treasurer, and President details
- Complete annual statement by end of year

**Practical Interpretation:** This is a critical compliance function. As an incorporated association in Victoria, Woodend Golf Club must maintain current records with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The Secretary must ensure that any changes to office bearers are reported promptly and that the annual statement is completed accurately and on time. Non-compliance can result in penalties or loss of incorporated status.

**Note:** Previous Secretary offered to complete the current year's annual statement, providing transition support.

### 8. Victorian Liquor and Gaming

**Primary Responsibility:** Liquor license compliance and management

**Key Systems:**
- **URL:** https://liquor.vcglr.vic.gov.au/liquorportal/Login.aspx
- **User:** woodendgolfclub@gmail.com
- **Password:** vczrN9ChH6GuGNx6h

**Practical Interpretation:** This function ensures the club maintains its liquor license in good standing. The Secretary must be aware of license conditions, renewal dates, and any reporting requirements. Any changes to club operations that affect liquor service (e.g., extended hours, new events) may require license amendments or notifications to the VCGLR.

### 9. Macedon Ranges Shire Council

**Primary Responsibility:** Local government liaison and facility maintenance coordination

**Key Contacts:**
- **General Maintenance:** mrsc@mrsc.vic.gov.au
- **Sport and Recreation:** Daniel Trevillian (dtrevillian@mrsc.vic.gov.au)
- **Escalations:** Simon Finlay (simon.finlay@mrsc.vic.gov.au)

**Additional Oversight:**
- Food safety requirements

**Practical Interpretation:** As the golf club likely operates on council-owned land, this relationship is critical. The Secretary acts as the primary liaison for maintenance requests, facility issues, and compliance matters (particularly food safety if the club serves food). Building a positive working relationship with council officers, particularly Daniel Trevillian, will facilitate smoother operations and potential support for future grant applications or facility improvements.

### 10. Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions – Grants Portal

**Primary Responsibility:** Grant application and management

**Key Systems:**
- **URL:** https://businessvic.secure.force.com/GrantsPortalLogin
- **User:** woodendgolfclub@gmail.com
- **Password:** Woodend3442!

**Practical Interpretation:** This portal provides access to state government grants for sports and recreation facilities. The Secretary should monitor available grants that align with club needs (e.g., facility upgrades, equipment purchases, accessibility improvements) and coordinate applications with the Board and Treasurer. Successful grant applications can significantly enhance club facilities without burdening members with increased fees.

**Strategic Opportunity:** Develop a 3-5 year facility improvement plan that can be matched to available grant programs.

### 11. Insurances

**Primary Responsibility:** Insurance policy management and renewals

**Key Contacts:**
- **Broker:** Gallagher
- **Contact:** Alex Borth
  - Mobile: +61 421 975 751
  - Email: Alex.Borth@ajg.com.au
- **Renewal Period:** April (most years)

**Key Documents:**
- Asset register (attached in handover - requires updating)

**Practical Interpretation:** Insurance is a critical risk management function. The Secretary must ensure that all club assets are adequately insured and that the asset register is kept current. When renewals are issued (typically April), the Secretary should review coverage with the Treasurer and Board to ensure it remains appropriate for club operations. Any new assets (equipment, improvements) should be added to the register and reported to the broker.

**Action Required:** Update the asset register (current version dated April 2024).

### 12. Annual General Meeting (AGM)

**Primary Responsibility:** AGM planning, notification, and execution

**Key Requirements:**
- **Notification Period:** 30 days prior to meeting
- **Typical Timing:** End of November
- **Required Documents:**
  - Audited financial statements (prepared by Rotallio with Treasurer)
  - Annual reports
  - Minutes from previous AGM
  - Notice of meeting and agenda

**Practical Interpretation:** The AGM is the most significant member meeting of the year, where the Board reports to members, financial statements are presented, and elections are held (if required). The Secretary is responsible for ensuring proper notice is given, all required documents are prepared and distributed, and the meeting is conducted in accordance with the club's constitution and the Associations Incorporation Reform Act 2012 (Vic).

**Best Practices:**
- Begin planning 6-8 weeks before the meeting
- Coordinate with Treasurer on financial statement preparation
- Prepare comprehensive annual report highlighting club achievements
- Ensure quorum requirements are communicated to members
- Take detailed minutes for the official record

### 13. Sponsorships

**Primary Responsibility:** Sponsorship coordination and administration

**Key Process:**
- Treasurer invoices sponsors for each financial year
- Secretary coordinates sponsorship agreements and recognition

**Practical Interpretation:** While the Treasurer handles invoicing, the Secretary should maintain sponsorship records, coordinate sponsorship agreements, and ensure sponsors receive appropriate recognition (e.g., signage, website acknowledgment, newsletter mentions). This function requires coordination with the Treasurer and potentially the social media team to ensure sponsors feel valued and are likely to renew.

**Note:** Previous Secretary indicated a need to "catch up" on this topic, suggesting it may require attention.

### 14. Website

**Primary Responsibility:** Website content coordination

**Key Contact:**
- **Web Designer:** Jono Cowdery
  - Email: info@easywebdesign.com.au

**Practical Interpretation:** While the Secretary is not responsible for technical website maintenance, they serve as the liaison for content updates. This includes ensuring club information is current (contact details, membership information, fees, events), coordinating with Jono for updates, and potentially providing content for news or announcements.

### 15. Employment Agreements

**Primary Responsibility:** Staff onboarding documentation

**Key Process:**
1. Prepare employment agreement for new staff member
2. Match job classification to award pay rate
3. Coordinate with Treasurer for payroll and superannuation setup

**Key Documents:**
- Employment agreement templates (in Google Docs - require updating)

**Practical Interpretation:** This function requires knowledge of relevant industrial awards (likely the Hospitality Industry Award or similar) to ensure staff are classified and paid correctly. The Secretary must ensure employment agreements are compliant with Fair Work requirements and that all necessary documentation is completed before a new staff member commences. Coordination with the Treasurer is essential for payroll setup.

**Action Required:** Update employment agreement templates to reflect current award conditions.

### 16. Room Bookings

**Primary Responsibility:** Facility hire coordination

**Key Information:**
- **CWA (Country Women's Association):** Monthly meetings, free of charge
  - Contact: Megan Sharkie - 0410 554 095
- **Other Bookings:** Require Board discussion due to previous issues

**Practical Interpretation:** This function involves balancing community goodwill (free use by CWA) with potential revenue opportunities and risk management. The note about "issues we have had" suggests that room bookings may have caused problems in the past (e.g., damage, noise, liability). The Secretary should work with the Board to develop a clear room hire policy that addresses these concerns while remaining open to appropriate community use.
