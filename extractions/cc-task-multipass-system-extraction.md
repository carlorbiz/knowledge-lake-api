## Pass 3: Per-Thread Learnings

**Extracted 4 learnings:**

### Methodology

**Thread 2:** Methodology: A single-pass "summarise this" approach loses:
- The connections between topics
- The evolution of u
- Details: A single-pass "summarise this" approach loses:
- The connections between topics
- The evolution of understanding within topics
- The spark moments ("Jan said X which made me realise Y")
- The thinking pattern itself (which is teaching gold for Nera)

**The Solution:**
A multi-pass extraction tool that runs locally, takes as long as needed, and produces structured learning output ready for Knowledge Lake ingestion. Strategy:
    - Chunk at natural break points (topic shifts if detectable)
    - Overlap chunks to preserve context
    - Pass accumulated understanding forward
