Let's recalibrate for $597-$797 price point:\n\ud83d\udcca Revised Revenue Model\nMastermind Premium Tier\n\nPrice: $597-$797 per course (or $1,497 for 3-course bundle)\nTarget Year 1: 100-200 customers\nRevenue: $60K-$160K\nStill solid for a digital product!\n\nAppSumo Tier (June 2026)\n\nPrice: $49-$97 LTD\nTarget: 1,000-2,000 customers\nRevenue: $49K-$194K\nPurpose: Volume + brand building\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Why This Pricing Makes MORE Sense\nMarket Alignment\n\nTypical Mastermind courses: $497-$997\nYour sweet spot: $597-$797\nBundle opportunity: $1,497 for all 3\nStill premium but achievable volume\n\nVolume Economics\nAt $597 per course:\n\n10 sales/month = $6K MRR = $72K/year\n20 sales/month = $12K MRR = $144K/year\n30 sales/month = $18K MRR = $216K/year\n\nMuch more realistic than hoping for 4-5 sales/month at $2,997!\n\ud83d\udd04 Strategic Implications\nNow You DEFINITELY Need Automation\nAt $597 per customer:\n\nManual process for 200 customers = 100 hours/year\nMust automate welcome emails\nNeed efficient support system\nCan't spend 10 min/customer anymore\n\nGood News: Simpler Sales Process\n\n$597 = credit card decision (not board decision)\nFaster sales cycle\nHigher conversion rates\nCan test/iterate quickly\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Hybrid Automation Strategy\nWeek 1: Zapier/Make Setup\nMastermind Purchase (manual check)\n    \u2193\nGoogle Sheet (add customer)\n    \u2193\nZapier/Make webhook\n    \u2193\nSupabase (create user)\n    \u2193\nSendGrid (welcome email with magic link)\nTime per customer: 10 seconds (just add to sheet)\nMonthly Process\n\nCheck Mastermind sales daily (1 min)\nAdd new customers to Google Sheet\nAutomation handles the rest\nTotal time: 30 min/month for 50 customers\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Pricing Tiers Strategy\nOn Mastermind Platform\nOption 1: Individual Courses\n\nAI Leadership Foundations: $597\nAI Strategy Mastery: $597\nAI Implementation: $597\nBundle (save $294): $1,497\n\nOption 2: Subscription Model\n\nMonthly: $97/month (all access)\nAnnual: $597/year (save $567)\nLifetime: $1,497\n\nOn AppSumo (June 2026)\nLite Version:\n\nTier 1: $49 (1 course, no AI coach)\nTier 2: $79 (2 courses, limited AI)\nTier 3: $97 (3 courses, full AI)\n\n\ud83c\udfac Adjusted Implementation Plan\nPhase 1: MVP Launch (March 2026)\n\nLaunch at $397 (early bird)\nGet first 25 customers\nGather testimonials\nRefine based on feedback\n\nPhase 2: Price Optimization (April 2026)\n\nRaise to $597\nAdd bundle at $1,497\nTest subscription model\nTarget: 20 sales/month\n\nPhase 3: Scale (May-June 2026)\n\nOptimize for conversions\nAdd affiliate program\nPrepare AppSumo campaign\nTarget: 50 sales/month\n\n\u2705 The Realistic Math\nYear 1 Conservative Projection\n\nMonths 1-3: 10 sales/month @ $397 = $12K\nMonths 4-6: 20 sales/month @ $597 = $36K\nMonths 7-12: 30 sales/month @ $597 = $108K\nTotal Year 1: $156K\n\nWith AppSumo Boost\n\nAdd 1,000 LTD sales @ $49 = $49K\nAdjusted Total: $205K Year 1\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Why This Is BETTER\n\nAchievable volume - 30 sales/month is realistic\nFaster feedback loops - More customers = more data\nWord of mouth - More users = more referrals\nLess pressure - One $597 sale vs. finding one $2,997 buyer\nPortfolio approach - Multiple products, multiple price points\n\n\ud83d\udcad Final Perspective\n$597 is the sweet spot because:\n\nHigh enough to signal quality\nLow enough for impulse purchase\nPerfect for Mastermind audience\nAllows volume for optimization\nSustainable business model\n\nRemember: A $150K/year digital product business with 95% margins is still an exceptional outcome!\nReady to build for the RIGHT price point? \ud83c\udfafCI have a new dimension I want to now include in our PWA",
