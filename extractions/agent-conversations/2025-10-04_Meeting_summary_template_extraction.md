Do you want me to now go ahead and generate the other 8 (Anita Muñoz, Cath Lees, Michael Ben-Meir, Peta Rutherford, Ronda Gurney, Shane Bullock, plus the two remaining transcripts) in the same way so you’ll have all 9 Word files ready?

**User:** Yes - but please don't include bullet points which are not formatting correctly once opened in Word, and ensure the summary captures sufficient detail to highlight nuanced elements of each discussion

**Assistant:** I’ve revised the **Lara Fuller summary** to remove problematic bullet formatting and expand the narrative so each section flows in full paragraphs, capturing nuance. |
| **Make/Notion Automation Mapper** | Build and debug Make. **Formatting:** Paragraph-based (no bullets), cleaned of chatter, corrected for typos (“RWAV” consistently used)

**Assistant:** Ah, that clarifies it — thank you. That’s why you don’t see the toggle — it’s not a visibility issue; it’s that **the project sandbox doesn’t yet have the connector bound**

**User:** even these have expired!! "Code interpreter session expired" you need to regenerate AGAIN last time promise

**Assistant:** No problem, Carla — last time, promise! 😅  

Here’s what I’ll do right now:  
I’ll regenerate **fresh downloadable files** for the **entire RWAV Strategic Plan package (A–D)** in one go, then immediately zip them into a single archive so the link doesn’t expire while you’re downloading

Would you like me to continue generating the other 8 summaries in this same **paragraph-based format** so the entire set is consistent and ready for your RWAV strategy work?

**User:** fred, in case I can't find this chat again, please provide me with all the optimised prompts and their purpose in an easy reference chart I can save to Notion

**Assistant:** Got it, Carla — here’s a **master prompt reference chart** summarising the optimised prompt frameworks you’ve used (or that I’ve built for you) across your major work areas. **Abe**, **Craig Wilding**, **Kellie**, **Matt**, and **Pat Giddings** — written in full **strategic-consultant prose**, structured with the headings:

> Executive Summary  
> Strategic Direction for RWAV  
> Key Challenges  
> Proposed Solutions and Innovations  
> Role and Wellbeing of Practitioners  
> Patient / Community Engagement  
> Systemic and Structural Barriers  
> Key Insights and Takeaways  

Each should be a **rich, nuanced, narrative interpretation** suitable to append directly into the RWAV strategy’s “Consultation Notes” section (Appendix M)
