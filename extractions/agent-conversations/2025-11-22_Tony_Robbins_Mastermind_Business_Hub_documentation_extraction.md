- Details: **Access their Global Marketplace** for instant premium audience

### **The Perfect Tech Stack Simplification:**

**Before:** WordPress + WooCommerce/StoreEngine + ZenCommunity + PWA + payment gateway complexity

- **Mastermind Hub** = Sales, payments, community, marketing
- **Your PWA** = Premium learning experience embedded seamlessly
- **Result** = Clean, professional, enterprise-grade solution

### **Implementation Approach:**

1. **Claude:** ## 🔄 **Strategy Pivot: Manual-First Approach**

The lack of direct data access actually isn't a dealbreaker - it just means we start with a **semi-manual process** that's perfectly acceptable for premium pricing. **Claude:** ## 💰 **Reality Check: Adjusted Pricing Strategy**

You're absolutely right! Let's recalibrate for **$597-$797** price point:

## 📊 **Revised Revenue Model**

### **Mastermind Premium Tier**
- **Price**: $597-$797 per course (or $1,497 for 3-course bundle)
- **Target Year 1**: 100-200 customers
- **Revenue**: $60K-$160K
- **Still solid for a digital product!**

### **AppSumo Tier (June 2026)**
- **Price**: $49-$97 LTD
- **Target**: 1,000-2,000 customers  
- **Revenue**: $49K-$194K
- **Purpose**: Volume + brand building

## 🎯 **Why This Pricing Makes MORE Sense**

### **Market Alignment**
- **Typical Mastermind courses**: $497-$997
- **Your sweet spot**: $597-$797
- **Bundle opportunity**: $1,497 for all 3
- **Still premium** but achievable volume

### **Volume Economics**
At $597 per course:
- **10 sales/month** = $6K MRR = $72K/year
- **20 sales/month** = $12K MRR = $144K/year
- **30 sales/month** = $18K MRR = $216K/year

Much more realistic than hoping for 4-5 sales/month at $2,997!

## 🔄 **Strategic Implications**

### **Now You DEFINITELY Need Automation**

At $597 per customer:
- Manual process for 200 customers = 100 hours/year
- **Must automate** welcome emails
- Need efficient support system
- Can't spend 10 min/customer anymore

### **Good News: Simpler Sales Process**
- $597 = credit card decision (not board decision)
- Faster sales cycle
- Higher conversion rates
- Can test/iterate quickly

## 💡 **Hybrid Automation Strategy**
