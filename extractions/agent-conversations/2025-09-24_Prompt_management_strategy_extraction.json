Can I just ask if it would have any merit to separate the prompts out into audience and voice choice etc and use those choice parameters in alignment with the main course db properties? Sorry if this is unclear, I guess I am wondering the best way to ensure the correct prompt is being used - will the bundled approach in Notion be as valuable as it was meant o tbe in vercel?\n\n**Claude:**  I'd be happy to help you continue from your last conversation, but I'll need to search for the previous chat content to understand the full context of your project and the prompts. ** Looking at your current structure:\n\n## **Current Bundled Approach Analysis:**\n\nYour prompts",
