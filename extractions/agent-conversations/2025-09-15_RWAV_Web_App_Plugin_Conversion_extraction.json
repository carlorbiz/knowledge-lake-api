But now the licence issue means I'm an infernal loop and there are no humans to help at the other end! The instruction to deactivate then reactivate with the same licence is dangerous when I don't have that licence to reuse!!!!\n\n**Claude:** You're absolutely right to be cautious! Do NOT disconnect that license until we secure your license key first. Your site will continue working normally even with the \"mismatch\" warning - it's just a verification issue, not a functionality problem",
