This comprehensive dataset is going to allow me to create the most sophisticated and intelligent multi-layered Google Sheets architecture that perfectly preserves all your valuable structures, relationships, and workflows while building the coordination system your AI dashboard needs! \n\nThe level of detail in your agent prompts, project structures, and cross-references is fantastic - this is going to be a masterpiece! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udcca\u2728\n\n**User:** \n\n**Claude:**  Still standing by for your \"that's it, Claude\" signal!
