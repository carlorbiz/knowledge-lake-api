- Details: Health beyond just GPs, which is broader, and when we're talking about workforce issues in the health space, it's not just focusing on the workforce issue, which is the recruitment, which is where we've traditionally been focused. They're two separate issues. But if we flip the equation from actually needing more resources to actually distributing it better, we get to that whole issue of equity, of justice, of fairness and how we actually start to target that without necessarily impacting on the bottom line from a fiscal perspective and government perspective as well

- Details: But again, it comes back to that key question of actually what's the social impact? What's the community impact we're trying to achieve? If we're seeking social outcome measures and social impact, then we can break it down into those issues and those segments and then work out who's going to be responsible for each of those as well, which is going to be some of the key players we need to engage from that perspective. Data for Advocacy: A key opportunity is for RWAV to use its data not just for reporting requirements, but to build evidence-based cases for advocacy and influence policy on issues like NDIS pricing and funding inconsistencies. Leverage Cross-System Thinking: Encourage RWAV to understand the interconnectedness of funding streams (Primary Care, Aged Care, NDIS) and advocate for issues that impact the overall financial viability of rural practices

- Details: So this is all part of that evaluation, so that it's one thing to have a strategy, and then if you've got your business plan attached to that, but then it's understanding whether, in fact, you're achieving what you want to achieve. So what are we doing? What are we here for? How do we know if we're achieving what we set out to achieve? So in very simple terms, I mean, I remember doing this when I was at the Coliseum in Eastern, so we actually looked at some really key KPIs at a strategic level, at an operational level, that were all linked to the strategy, and then worked out, okay, what information or data do we need to understand whether we've hit that mark, whether we've met our outcome or target? Because you can have a hierarchy of targets as well, in terms of outcome measures and then inputs and so forth. So the data follows the need, the drive of the strategy

Executive Summary

This strategic consultation with Cath Lees provided exceptional insights into community-centred approaches to rural health workforce development through her leadership of the Committee for Echuca Moama (C4EM). The discussion explored practical approaches to community connection, grow-your-own workforce strategies, and the critical role of authentic community integration in healthcare professional retention. Key Strategic Discussion Points



Community-Centred Workforce Development Model

Committee for Echuca Moama represents innovative member-funded approach to community development addressing workforce challenges across multiple sectors

Structured subcommittee model includes workforce development, young professionals (Next Gen Connect), Women in Business, and tourism initiatives

Recognition that healthcare professionals require community connection first, professional identity second for successful rural integration

Emphasis on creating governance structures and support systems that welcome and integrate new community members

Comprehensive Community Integration Framework

Identification of diverse community stakeholders beyond healthcare including sports clubs, SES, women's networks, business chambers, and wine clubs

Understanding that rural workforce challenges extend beyond healthcare to include education, policing, and business sectors

Recognition that healthcare professionals need to see themselves as community members rather than transient service providers

Integration of arts and cultural activities as essential elements of community attractiveness and professional retention

Strategic Partnership and Connection Opportunities

RWAV positioned as ideal connector and data provider for community development initiatives
