This revealed that the problem isn't with content generation but with Absorb's system overriding spelling preferences. The user expressed considerable frustration with this automatic conversion, leading to discussion of various workarounds including account settings checks, explicit preservation instructions, phonetic markers, HTML escape characters, and contacting Absorb support about potential regional settings or bugs in their system",
