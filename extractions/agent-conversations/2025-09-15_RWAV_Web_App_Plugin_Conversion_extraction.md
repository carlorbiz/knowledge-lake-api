Have you created all these files with the code inside them?

**User:** Yep all set up as instructed - I just have this issue to contend with in my Elementor-hosted wordpress site. In the process of setting up my Cloudflare account for the AAE project, I accidentally moved my domain from GoDaddy to Cloudflare (actually I'm happy to reduce my ties with GoDaddy!) but while I fixed my DKIM and SPF issues in the DNS setting change, I failed to note the impact it would have on my actual website duh

- Details: ## **After You Fix This:**
You'll be able to proceed with installing our RWAV plugin without any issues. But now the licence issue means I'm an infernal loop and there are no humans to help at the other end! The instruction to deactivate then reactivate with the same licence is dangerous when I don't have that licence to reuse!!!!

**Claude:** You're absolutely right to be cautious! Do NOT disconnect that license until we secure your license key first. Your site will continue working normally even with the "mismatch" warning - it's just a verification issue, not a functionality problem

- Details: The conversation evolved from providing a complete enterprise solution to troubleshooting activation errors and ultimately simplifying the approach. Claude created a streamlined export manager that provides reliable JSON export functionality while maintaining placeholder methods for future PDF/Word/Excel capabilities. **Six Paths Strategic Exploration Framework** - Blue ocean strategy methodology

// use PhpOffice\PhpWord\PhpWord;
// use PhpOffice\PhpWord\IOFactory;
// use PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Spreadsheet;
// use PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Xlsx;
```

**Then find the export methods and replace them with simple versions:**

Replace the entire `export_to_pdf`, `export_to_word`, and `export_to_excel` methods with:

```php
private function export_to_pdf($data) {
    return array('success' => false, 'message' => 'PDF export will be available in next update');
}

private function export_to_word($data) {
    return array('success' => false, 'message' => 'Word export will be available in next update');
}

private function export_to_excel($data) {
    return array('success' => false, 'message' => 'Excel export will be available in next update');
}
```

This will allow the plugin to activate and work, with exports temporarily disabled. **Can you access your website now?** Let me know which recovery method worked, and then we can create a simpler, safer version of the plugin
