### Correction

**Thread 1:** Correction: Case Studies**
- 2-3 detailed case studies per module
- Each includes:
  - Scenario Description
  - 
- Details: Case Studies**
- 2-3 detailed case studies per module
- Each includes:
  - Scenario Description
  - Challenge/Problem Statement
  - 5 Discussion Questions
  - Teaching Notes for Facilitators
  - Relevant Standards

### **3. [Full scenario text continues]

### **Challenge/Problem Statement** (copy from LMS Upload file):
```
[Paste the full "Challenge/Problem Statement" text here]

Sarah needs to develop a strategy to address Margaret's resistance, ensure Dr. You can configure these as:

### **Question 1: [Application Question]**

**Question Type:** Essay/Open Response or Text Box (Large)

**Question Text:**
```
How can Sarah utilise the "Registrar Readiness Checklist" (Slide 5) to proactively identify and address potential issues related to team preparation in this scenario? Be specific about the checklist items and how they apply
- Confidence: medium

**Thread 4:** Correction: **Time management:**
   - Book longer appointments if needed
   - Recognize that better listening of
- Details: **Time management:**
   - Book longer appointments if needed
   - Recognize that better listening often SAVES time (fewer return visits)

**Follow-up:**
- Schedule review in 2 weeks
- Direct observation of 2-3 more consultations
- Discuss progress in supervision
- Celebrate improvements
- Adjust strategies if needed

**If Pattern Persists:**
- Explore deeper issues (anxiety, perfectionism)
- Consider referral to communication skills training
- Involve RTO if significant concern
- Document pattern and interventions

Relevant Research:
- Patients interrupted within 23 seconds on average (Beckman & Frankel, 1984)
- Interrupting patients increases diagnostic errors
- Active listening improves patient satisfaction and adherence
- Feedback effectiveness depends on psychological safety (Edmondson)

Medicolegal Considerations:
- Poor communication is leading cause of patient complaints
- Missed diagnoses often result from inadequate history-taking
- Documentation of communication skills feedback important if patterns persist

This scenario helps participants develop the courage and skill to provide difficult feedback effectively - a crucial supervisory competency. Explore potential underlying factors (learning difficulties, health issues, external stressors)

**Step 5:** Success Criteria Page

```
SUCCESS CRITERIA

You successfully demonstrated this competency if you:

✓ Communicated the severity of concerns clearly and directly
✓ Provided specific examples of performance gaps with evidence:
  - Multiple failed WBAs
  - Pattern of missed clinical findings
  - Inadequate documentation examples
  - Lack of progress despite interventions
✓ Acknowledged the registrar's effort and distress compassionately
✓ Assessed the registrar's insight:
  - "How do you feel you're progressing?"
  - "What do you think is contributing to the challenges?"
  - "Do you feel general practice is the right fit for you?"
✓ Explored potential underlying factors:
  - Undiagnosed learning difficulties (dyslexia, ADHD)
  - Health issues affecting performance (mental health, physical health)
  - External stressors (family crisis, financial problems)
  - Language/cultural barriers
  - Previous educational gaps
✓ Discussed all options objectively:
  - **Enhanced remediation plan** (if gaps are specific and addressable)
  - **Extended training time** (if progressing but slowly)
  - **Alternative career pathways** (other medical specialties, non-clinical roles)
  - **Program withdrawal** (if fundamental unsuitability)
✓ Explained the RTO's role and formal process:
  - Supervisor's recommendation goes to RTO
  - RTO conducts formal review
  - Registrar has right to respond
  - Decision involves multiple parties
✓ Offered immediate support:
  - EAP counseling for emotional support
  - RTO registrar support coordinator
  - Career counseling services
  - Educational psychologist (if learning difficulties suspected)
✓ Documented the conversation thoroughly
✓ Scheduled RTO meeting within 1 week
✓ Provided clear next steps and timeline
✓ Maintained compassion while being professionally honest
✓ Avoided either false hope or premature definitiveness

ASSESSOR GUIDANCE:

This is an Expert Application scenario requiring integration of:
- Clinical judgment about competence and safety
- Skilled difficult conversation management
- Knowledge of training program processes
- Assessment of insight and potential
- Balancing multiple competing obligations
- Managing own emotions and discomfort

Observe the participant's ability to:
- Deliver potentially career-ending news with skill and compassion
- Maintain clarity while acknowledging complexity
- Assess insight and potential honestly
- Navigate the tension between compassion and professional responsibility
- Follow appropriate processes and involve RTO correctly
- Provide actionable next steps
- Manage their own discomfort with the situation

This scenario assesses Expert Application because it requires:
- Integration of multiple domains (clinical assessment, communication, system knowledge)
- Management of high-stakes, emotionally charged situation
- Sound professional judgment in ambiguous circumstances
- Balancing competing ethical obligations
