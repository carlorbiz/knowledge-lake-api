- Details: Let me clarify what's happening:

## **What Actually Works:**

**Method That Auto-Generates Quizzes:**
- Upload 20-30 page PDF guide (raw educational content)
- Let Absorb Create AI decide **everything**: slide structure + content + quizzes
- Result: ✅ Working quizzes, but you lose control over slide content/voiceovers

## **What You Tried (Didn't Work):**

**Your Module 1 Upload:**
- Provided 12 exact slides with voiceover scripts
- Added MCQs and scenarios 
- Instructed: "use the slide structure and content exactly as provided for the first 12 slides, and create quizzes and branching scenarios"
- Result: ❌ AI used exact slides but **didn't generate interactive quizzes/scenarios** - just rendered educational content

## **The Core Problem:**

Absorb Create AI has **conflicting instructions**:
- "Use exact slide content" = Don't modify anything
- "Create quizzes and branching scenarios" = Add interactive elements

The AI interprets "use exactly as provided" as "don't add anything," so it **ignores the quiz generation request**. "

## **Key Question:**

Looking at your screenshots (which show beautiful working quizzes and branching scenarios), **were those created by:**

**Option A:** Letting Absorb AI decide everything (the PDF upload method)?

**Option B:** Or did you manually build them in Absorb after upload?

If Option A - can you share what that PDF content looked like? That would show me the format Absorb expects. If Option B - then we need a different approach: **format the MCQs/scenarios in a way that tells Absorb Create AI "these are pre-structured assessments, convert them into interactive elements

- Details: As the practice manager, describe your immediate first step to address this situation and explain why this approach is most appropriate. This approach promotes understanding, respects both perspectives, and aims for a mutually agreeable solution rather than taking sides or ignoring the issue. What strategy would be MOST effective to support the registrar's learning and improve their efficiency?

**Answer Options:**
A) Insisting the registrar learn the system independently through online tutorials
B) Assigning a dedicated mentor within the practice to provide one-on-one training and support ✓
C) Minimising the registrar's use of the EHR system to avoid errors
D) Scolding the registrar for their lack of proficiency

**Rationale:** Providing personalised support through a dedicated mentor allows the registrar to receive tailored guidance, ask questions in a safe environment, and develop proficiency at their own pace
