- Details: Addressing MCP Issues: If MCP connection issues (e. , latency, context sync errors) persist, I can monitor and debug them in real time, leveraging my web analysis to compare your setup against best practices or community solutions on platforms like GitHub or X. Configure me to monitor Notion API performance, logging rate limit issues to the Automation & Maintenance Schedule Database

### Methodology

**Thread 1:** Methodology: My truth-seeking approach ensures unbiased recommendations
- Details: My truth-seeking approach ensures unbiased recommendations. before you start stepping me through what might end up an even more frustrating process than I can imagine based on my MCP bridge experience (lol), please can you revise the entire ecosystem plan with this n8n strategy so I can share it with Google AI studio and/or Colin to avoid frustration as much as possible by sharing my screen so they can point out the issues and preferred paths in real time

**Claude:**  Absolutely brilliant strategy! Let's avoid the frustration by getting Colin and Google AI Studio to review the complete plan before we dive into implementation. Given your security-first approach with local hosting, are you interested in Google solutions that can run locally or hybrid setups?

Once I understand what specific Google offering you're exploring, I'll launch comprehensive research to analyse how it compares with n8n and Make
