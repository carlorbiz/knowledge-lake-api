### Correction

**Summary:** **Conversation Overview**

The user worked thr
- Details: # VS Code ARM64 Extension Compatibility

**Summary:** **Conversation Overview**

The user worked through resolving VS Code compatibility issues on their ARM64 Windows device after upgrading from Windows Home to Windows Pro. The OS upgrade from Windows Home to Windows Pro on your ARM64 device could indeed be related to this issue, especially if VS Code and its extensions were installed before the upgrade. This is definitely the right approach - one clean installation in your admin profile!

**User:** Would it impact the install in progress if i switched profiles before it finishes?

**Claude:**  **Don't switch profiles while Visual Studio is installing!** 

This could cause problems because:

- You could end up with a corrupted or incomplete installation
- You'd likely have to start the installation over

4. Clean up system PATH (optional):**
- Right-click "This PC" → Properties → Advanced system settings
- Environment Variables → System variables → PATH
- Look for any VS Code entries and remove them

**Pro tip:** You can also use a tool like Revo Uninstaller (free) which will find and remove leftover files automatically, but the manual method above is perfectly fine. This is definitely the right approach - one clean installation in your admin profile!
