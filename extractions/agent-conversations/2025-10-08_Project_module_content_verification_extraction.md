### Correction

**Thread 1:** Correction: 2) properly integrated

### **No Issues Found:**
- No content deletions
- No contradictions with ori
- Details: 2) properly integrated

### **No Issues Found:**
- No content deletions
- No contradictions with original slides
- No terminology inconsistencies

---

## Verdict: ✅ **APPROVED**

The learning objectives and module development have:
- ✅ **Preserved** all original slide content
- ✅ **Honoured** the structure and emphasis of original materials
- ✅ **Enhanced** with current 2025 standards and terminology
- ✅ **Added** only critical policy updates documented in Style Guide

**Recommendation:** Proceed with confidence. **Stage 1 - Internal discussion:**
   - Practice manager acknowledges receipt of concern within 24 hours
   - Conducts internal audit: retrieves employment contract, reviews calculation methodology, checks payroll records
   - Identifies error: calculation used receipts methodology but contract specifies billings
   - Within 5 business days: meets with registrar, acknowledges error, provides corrected calculation showing $1,247 underpayment
   - Commits to correcting underpayment in next pay cycle with retrospective adjustment
   - Implements system improvement: payroll system now flags calculation methodology from contract

**Outcome:** Dispute resolved at Stage 1. These findings emphasise rostering as a patient safety issue, not merely an administrative function
- Confidence: medium

### MODULE 5: PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING CONFLICT ✅
**Slide Topics Covered:**
- Top 10 causes of conflict ✓
- Prevention (interview, welcome pack, NTCER review) ✓
- Early intervention (warning signs, check-ins) ✓
- Formal resolution (documentation, confidentiality) ✓

**Learning Objectives Alignment:** All 5 objectives aligned with 3-step approach. length > 100) {
  // Research exists - CONTINUE automation

    hasResearch: true,
    summary: researchNotes,  // Full 2500-3500 words

    method: 'manual'
  };
}

**If NO research:** Automation STOPS, creates research brief, user must complete it first. **Archival record** (partial)

## Why Only Partial Research Used?

Looking at the truncation strategy:

| Generation Stage | Chars Used | Rationale |
|------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Slides** | 2000 | Max context for 12 slide generation |
| **LMS Document** | 1500 | Enough for citations + grounding |
| **Workbook** | 1500 | Enough for practical activities |
| **Case Studies** | 1500 | Enough for scenario basis |
| **Module Content Complete** | 500 | Summary reference only |

**Why not use full 2500-3500 words?**
- API token limits per request
- Focused context = better outputs
- Key information front-loaded in research foundation structure

## Your Next Steps

### **Immediate Action Required:**

- Confidence: medium

**Thread 2:** Methodology: - Registrar discloses Friday evening work finishing 9pm, driving home (arriving 10pm), returning to 
- Details: - Registrar discloses Friday evening work finishing 9pm, driving home (arriving 10pm), returning to training practice Saturday 8am (10-hour rest period not met)

**Joint risk assessment:**
- Immediate risk: Registrar potentially unsafe for complex Saturday consultations
- Contributing factors: Financial pressure from exam costs, lack of awareness about disclosure requirement
- Risk to patients: Increased error risk due to cumulative sleep debt over multiple weekends

**Mitigation implemented:**
- Immediate: Roster adjusted so Saturday shifts start 11am (allowing 13-hour rest period)
- Short-term: Reduced Saturday patient load from 4/hour to 3/hour
- Medium-term: Discussion of financial pressures, referral to GPRA for exam cost support resources
- System improvement: Orientation process revised to explicitly discuss outside work disclosure

**Outcome:**
- Registrar grateful for supportive response rather than punitive
- Saturday performance improved (supervisor reports)
- No further fatigue-related concerns for remainder of term

*Case Study 2: Practice roster creating fatigue risk*

**Background:**
- GPT2 registrar, part-time 0. 4 hours weekly (30 min × 8 half-days)
  - Day length reduced to maximum 9 hours per day
  - Additional reception staff rostered during busy period to manage patient flow
- Registrar return to work meeting:
  - Apology for pressure created
  - Revised roster presented
  - Commitment to monthly roster review
- System improvement:
  - Practice manager receives GPSA rostering compliance training
  - Monthly roster audit against NTCER requirements implemented
  - Automatic alerts when roster exceeds teaching/admin time limits

**Outcome:**
- Registrar returned to work week 8, completed term successfully
- Placement evaluation scores improved from 3. 2 provides clear minimum standards that, when implemented systematically, prevent the majority of rostering-related conflicts and welfare concerns
- Confidence: medium
