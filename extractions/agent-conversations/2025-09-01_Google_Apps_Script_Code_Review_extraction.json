The conversation began with Claude reviewing the user's existing script, identifying critical issues including hardcoded API keys, duplicate functions, missing error handling, and potential generation of inappropriate Australian colloquialisms in professional content. During testing, the user identified several critical bugs: module extraction was failing to capture all modules (12 identified but only 11 populated), modification requests were clearing data incorrectly, and voiceover scripts weren't distributing properly to individual slides",
