- Details: # Prompt management strategy

**Summary:** **Conversation Overview**

The user is working on transforming their N8N workflow architecture from a problematic Vercel-based system to an intelligent Notion-based prompt management system. They had been experiencing significant issues with their existing setup where N8N was downloading a 70KB prompts. js bundle from Vercel for each AI agent call, using only 2-3KB of content while wasting 97% of bandwidth and encountering truncation problems that caused incomplete prompts

- Details: ## **Corrected Architecture:**

**Course Concepts Database** (user form input)
- Target Audience (select property - user choice)
- Voice Choice (select property - user choice)
- Course Concept, Source URLs, User Email, etc. Looking back at our conversation, your Smart Prompt Selection code is working perfectly:

**Summary:** **Conversation Overview**

The user is working on transforming their N8N workflow architecture from a problematic Vercel-based system to an intelligent Notion-based prompt management system. Can I just ask if it would have any merit to separate the prompts out into audience and voice choice etc and use those choice parameters in alignment with the main course db properties? Sorry if this is unclear, I guess I am wondering the best way to ensure the correct prompt is being used - will the bundled approach in Notion be as valuable as it was meant o tbe in vercel?
