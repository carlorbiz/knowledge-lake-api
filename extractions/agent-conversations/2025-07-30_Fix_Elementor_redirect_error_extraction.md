## Pass 3: Per-Thread Learnings

**Extracted 5 learnings:**

### Correction

**Thread 1:** Correction: Now that means that I've got this issue where do I go to fix this that when I plug in carlobiz
- Details: Now that means that I've got this issue where do I go to fix this that when I plug in carlobiz. au the images don't show it's not being indexed as you can see there from what I've attached there is an issue with the search console because of the redirect not being set up properly so it should automatically be going to the home page but even when I try to get it to set to the home page it's not working. I can show you what I've got in terms of the DNS records on GoDaddy, could you help me fix this?

**Assistant:** Thanks for the detailed background — you're definitely not alone in dealing with Elementor redirect issues after switching themes or setups
- Confidence: medium

**Thread 6:** Correction: Might that be causing an issue? The images definitely show in Elementor Editor - I was able to open 
- Details: Might that be causing an issue? The images definitely show in Elementor Editor - I was able to open the logo (banner) on a separate tab and it retrieved it successfully as uploaded media

**Assistant:** Yes — you've just uncovered **the missing link**. 💡

You're right: if the **logo and site icon are managed through the theme**, **not directly placed via Elementor widgets**, that **can absolutely cause image loading issues** on the homepage **if**:
- The theme is trying to pull from outdated or misaligned paths
- Elementor and WordPress aren’t syncing on which logo to load
- There's a difference between what **Elementor sees in the editor** and what’s actually rendered **on the live homepage** (especially with caching, redirect remnants, or mixed theme resets)

---

## 🧩 What’s Likely Happening

Here’s why this happens **only on the homepage**:

- Your theme (Astra, in your case) is responsible for the **global header**, which includes the logo. Check:
   - Is retina logo turned on? (Disable it temporarily)
   - Is there a custom logo width? (Set it to auto or a fixed px size)
   - Is the logo hidden on the homepage?

- Confidence: medium

**Thread 7:** Correction: Right-click the logo → **Open in new tab**
   - It should now load with a clean `https://` URL and n
- Details: Right-click the logo → **Open in new tab**
   - It should now load with a clean `https://` URL and no errors

---

## 🛠️ Optional (but Highly Recommended)

If you're still seeing “null” alt text or broken rendering:

### Install the Plugin: **Enable Media Replace**
- Plugin name: *Enable Media Replace* by ShortPixel
- Go to `Media > Library`
- Replace the logo file (not just re-upload)
  - This ensures every reference using the image ID is refreshed — no dead links

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Logo not loading on homepage | Theme is calling outdated or unsynced logo reference |
| Logo shows in Elementor editor only | Elementor shows widget-level assets, not theme-controlled ones |
| “null” alt text or image breaks | Usually from dynamic logo or image reference not being set |

✅ Re-assign logo + icon in **Customizer**  
✅ Clear cache + regenerate Elementor assets  
✅ Open homepage in **incognito** to test clean rendering

---

Let me know once you’ve done that and want me to take one last look from the outside. Save & publish

✅ This guarantees your logo is shown **via Elementor** and bypasses the buggy `get_custom_logo()` theme call completely. If the **Elementor image block itself is showing “null”** on the homepage — even **after you confirmed it’s working in the editor and on other pages** — that tells me this isn’t a logo-only or header-only issue anymore
- Confidence: medium

**Thread 8:** Correction: **Use Live Preview Debug Trick**

This little test is surprisingly powerful:

1
- Details: **Use Live Preview Debug Trick**

This little test is surprisingly powerful:

1. This tells WordPress to render the site using the *current* customizer values (bypassing theme’s layout memory)

If the correct menus show here but not on the real site:
→ It’s definitely a caching or orphaned layout issue — not a content one

---

### 💣 Optional Nuke: Elementor Header Template

If all else fails and you want **total control forever**:

- Create a new **Header template** via `Elementor > Templates > Theme Builder`
- Add your logo + nav menu widgets
- Set it to display on **entire site**
- Publish

This **completely bypasses Astra’s header system**, giving you full control of the header regardless of theme quirks

---

## ✅ In Summary

| Step | Why it Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Manage Locations | Safely unlinks theme from ghost menu assignments |
| Permalink Save | Flushes routing and menu cache |
| Elementor Tools | Clears layout-level caching across the site |
| Page-Level Settings | Ensures homepage isn’t using a rogue layout |
| Elementor Header Template | Total freedom from theme-based menus |

Shall I create a clean Elementor header layout for you (brand-matched with full responsiveness), or guide you through doing it step-by-step?

You're so close to banishing the WordPress gremlins — truly, you’ve done 90% of the hard work already. ---

## 🚨 The “Default Template” vs Elementor Templates

This is **hugely relevant** to your menu issue and layout weirdness

### Methodology

- You’ve likely edited and rebuilt it after the theme swap
- It’s not a

- You’ve likely edited and rebuilt it after the theme swap
- It’s not affected by the homepage assignment or template confusion
