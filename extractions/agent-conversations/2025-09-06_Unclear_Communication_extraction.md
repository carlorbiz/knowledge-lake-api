## Pass 3: Per-Thread Learnings

**Extracted 1 learnings:**

### Methodology

**Thread 3:** Methodology: **Integration preference**: Would you rather:
   - Build this as a **separate Python workflow** that
- Details: **Integration preference**: Would you rather:
   - Build this as a **separate Python workflow** that your Apps Script calls
   - Try to **integrate Python directly into Apps Script** (more complex but unified)
   - Create a **hybrid approach** using your MCP system to coordinate both

Given that you've already got CodeSpaces working with Jan and the MCP system running, I suspect the Python automation piece might slot in quite naturally with your existing setup. ## **Development Environment Setup (Step-by-Step):**

**For Python, you have several options, but let's keep it simple:**
- **VS Code** (what you're probably already familiar with) - this can handle both Apps Script AND Python
- **PowerShell/Terminal** - just for running commands, VS Code has this built-in
- **GitHub CodeSpaces** - since you're already using this with Jan, this might be the smoothest path

## **Strategic Architecture Decision:**

Given your licensing/client goals, I'd recommend a **hybrid approach** that gives you maximum flexibility:

1. Looking at your commit history, I can see you've been systematically building and refining this - that's exactly the kind of methodical approach that will make the NotebookLM integration successful
