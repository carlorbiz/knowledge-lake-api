- Details: But if you can Have a a play with that for me and devise The the strategy that When I hit solid ground, I can literally just copy and paste your suggested inputs into creating those custom AI agency notion. ## 🎯 **REALITY CHECK: What We Can Actually Do Today**

**Available Now:**
- ✅ **One Personal Agent per workspace** 
- ✅ **Custom instructions page** (like the template I created)
- ✅ **Multi-step tasks within Notion** (create/edit pages, databases)
- ✅ **Web search and connected tools access**

**NOT Available Yet:**
- ❌ Multiple Custom Agents running on triggers/schedules
- ❌ Native agent builder platform
- ❌ Autonomous background processing

## 📝 **ADJUSTED STRATEGY**

**Keep:** The single Course Creation Agent with mode-based instructions  
**Adjust:** Rely more heavily on N8N for automation triggers and external AI calls
