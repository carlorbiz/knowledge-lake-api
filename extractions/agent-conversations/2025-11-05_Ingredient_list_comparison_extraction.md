This is built specifically to:

- avoid sudden D-vitamin drop
- avoid nervous system “snapback” post-amitriptyline
- avoid double NMN / spermidine exposure
- respect your AM/PM split habit

### Legend
- **AM stack** = “morning” things historically (Mega B+, ginseng, etc)
- **PM stack** = your “night” things (magnesium, glucosamine, probiotic, Metamucil)

### KEEP THROUGHOUT TAPER
- Glucosamine (PM)
- Blackmores Hair/Nails/Skin (AM)
- Metamucil (PM)
- Probiotic (PM)
- Calcium+D (but dose taper built in below)

## WEEK 1 (Mon 3 Nov → Sun 9 Nov)
**Goal = reduce stimulants + excess B**

| item | plan |
|---|---|
| Mega B+ | drop to **every 2nd day** |
| Guarana/Ginseng | **stop now** |
| Swisse Magnesium | continue normal |
| AgeMate Longevity | keep 1 scoop/day |
| Calcium+D | stay at current 2/day |
| Swisse Vit D | stay at 1/day |

---

## WEEK 2 (Mon 10 Nov → Sun 16 Nov)
**Goal = prepare receptor reset**

| item | plan |
|---|---|
| Mega B+ | drop to **every 3rd day** only |
| Guarana/Ginseng | remain stopped |
| Swisse Magnesium | **stop** (AgeMate already has ~255 mg Mg) |
| AgeMate Longevity | still 1 scoop/day |
| Calcium+D | reduce to **1/day** only |
| Swisse Vit D | reduce to **Mon/Wed/Fri only** (3x/week)** |

> This is the key Vit D loading drop  
> AgeMate still gives 8,000 IU/day → so you’re NOT deficient

**(Note — this is why we don’t remove Agemate before IM8 kicks in)**

---

## Day 0 = Sunday 16 Nov (the night before IM8 start)

- LAST dose of AgeMate Longevity powder
- LAST dose of Mega B+ (if it happens to fall on this day in the “every 3rd day” pattern)
- Calcium+D 1x
- Swisse Vit D **no dose** (leave a clean gap)

## Pass 3: Per-Thread Learnings

**Extracted 3 learnings:**

### Correction

**Thread 3:** Correction: It explains **WHY** these two lanes are non-negotiable for you:

### 1) Joint / bone matrix support 
- Details: It explains **WHY** these two lanes are non-negotiable for you:

### 1) Joint / bone matrix support  
→ because of 10 years of bisphosphonate / bone agents / bone turnover manipulation

### 2) Nail matrix recovery  
→ because post-chemo nail plate keratinisation is SLOW and fragile

So: **Glucosamine** and **Silica/Biotin/Zinc** are not “nice to have” vanity things — they are targeted support for two tissue systems that have been chronically stressed AND have slow turnover

### Methodology

**Thread 3:** Methodology: Amitriptyline — even at low dose — sits in a *different domain* to supplements:

- it modulates cent
- Details: Amitriptyline — even at low dose — sits in a *different domain* to supplements:

- it modulates central pain perception
- it modulates sleep architecture
- it modulates serotonin / norepinephrine reuptake tone

So even though you’ve basically phased it out and aren’t including it as part of the active “stack” now — it is still relevant for two reasons:

**1) your baseline nervous system tone is recalibrating right now**  
→ so sudden removal of multiple *other* supports at the same time is not ideal  
(we will not do a “big stop-all” manoeuvre)

**2) guarana + ginseng + high-dose B** can push sympathetic drive up  
→ and if you remove amitriptyline at the same time as adding extra stimulatory actives  
→ that could create an unnecessary spike / jitters / pain-sensitivity rebound

So YES — that context changes the strategy slightly. ---

### Core principle:

We are going to **replace** your metabolic / immune / energy boosters with IM8  
BUT  
we will **keep** your bone + nail support supplements
