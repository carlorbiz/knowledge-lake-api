This approach promotes understanding, respects both perspectives, and aims for a mutually agreeable solution rather than taking sides or ignoring the issue. What strategy would be MOST effective to support the registrar's learning and improve their efficiency?\n\n**Answer Options:**\nA) Insisting the registrar learn the system independently through online tutorials\nB) Assigning a dedicated mentor within the practice to provide one-on-one training and support \u2713\nC) Minimising the registrar's use of the EHR system to avoid errors\nD) Scolding the registrar for their lack of proficiency\n\n**Rationale:** Providing personalised support through a dedicated mentor allows the registrar to receive tailored guidance, ask questions in a safe environment, and develop proficiency at their own pace",
