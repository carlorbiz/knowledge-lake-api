After extensive debugging and testing, they successfully established API connectivity to all four core databases: Meetings (`24d94405-56f7-81f2-af8e-f80fedea4121`), Tasks (`23794405-56f7-8157-83f7-db9344a6fd2d`), Areas (`23794405-56f7-8115-821c-ff015bea782c`), and Projects (`23794405-56f7-81b6-8db0-df6b6f75b296`). To address the problem of losing context when chat sessions end, they created conversation tracking databases for each AI agent, starting with Claude Conversations (`24d94405-56f7-80b1-b831-d1b12f7efff2`) and Fred Conversations (`39e71c7069ce40c8b64af0a3021a0a1d`)",
