**Found 1 topic threads:**

### Thread 1: Sync VS Code Files
- **Lines:** 0-5449

- **Keywords:** 0, 03, 09, 1, 10
- **Breakthroughs:** 1
  - "wav files at col C;

C: Interactive - where the instructions and content detail for creating Assessments and Role Play Scenarios will be stored



The purpose of this is to provide a new structure using a mix of n8n and Apps Script that allows the user more access to oversee the course creation and contribute / feed into the process with human intelligence that makes the outcome truly unique

At an organisational level, this will later need to include access to internal files to enrich the research foundation/course creation by allowing vertex ai to search the user's own Google Workspace files for relevant materials on the designated topic/Theme

I will need your help to make this work as intended!!
