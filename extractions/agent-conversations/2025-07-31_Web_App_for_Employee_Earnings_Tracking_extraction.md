## **Recommended Distribution Method:**

I'd suggest **Option 1 (Direct Download)** because:
- ✅ **Complete privacy** - data stays on their device
- ✅ **Works offline** - no internet required after download
- ✅ **No ongoing hosting costs** for GPSA
- ✅ **Future-proof** - won't break if external services change
- ✅ **Professional** - members own their copy

Would you like me to help you create a distribution email template or provide instructions for any of these methods?

**User:** Yes please Claude! I'll definitely follow your advice re option 1 if you can please draft an email explaining how to install and use the app from this process?
