Would you like me to:
- Start building your Glide app structure and Sheets backend?
- Draft a full 30-day prompt pack (with optional audio script)?

## 🟡 **Suggested Strategy**
- Use **free Glide tier** to build and test with close users
- Collect feedback + refine content and flow
- Upgrade to **Starter plan ($25/month)** only when:
  - You need more rows
  - You want to allow more private users
  - You're ready for custom branding or monetisation

Would you like me to prepare a starter Google Sheet in the correct structure for Glide so you can link it directly and begin building in the free version? I can also walk you through how to set up user-specific journaling on the free plan

Would you like me to regenerate the Prompts and Reset Phrases spreadsheets with the column rena
- Details: ---

Would you like me to regenerate the Prompts and Reset Phrases spreadsheets with the column renamed to `Script_Notes`, so it's clear it's placeholder/internal for now?

**User:** No it's ok, I'll follow your instructions and rename that column in both sheet now (and leave rows empty?)

**Assistant:** Perfect — yes, your approach is spot on:

### ✅ To Summarise:

- **Rename `AudioScript` to `Script_Notes`** in both the **Prompts** and **Reset Phrases** sheets
- **Leave the cells empty** where you haven’t drafted anything yet — totally fine!
- This column can stay hidden from the user-facing app view, but will be super helpful later when you're ready to:
  - Record voiceovers
  - Add audio player components
  - Batch-create audio assets without reinventing your tone each time

---

You're building this in a clean, scalable way, Carla — let me know when you're ready to set up screen flows in Glide or begin scripting a short onboarding voice clip. I will create a separate table for the Tags as a new Google Sheet?

**Assistant:** Yes, exactly! Creating a **separate Tags table** as a new sheet in your Glide-connected Google Sheet is the best approach
