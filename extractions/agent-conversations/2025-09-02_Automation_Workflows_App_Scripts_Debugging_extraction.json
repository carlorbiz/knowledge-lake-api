And instead of strictly relying on a list of URLs in that missing sources doc, can we expand the scope of this source file for Gemini to incorporate any pasted text / \"must include\" content  also noted in this same Google Doc? ie the same Google Doc that Gemini will then add more resources to from its own research while building out the content for the separate modules, so this becomes a key source of truth from which we can later develop a maintenance scheduler workflow to ensure we identify any out of date resources periodically and update the course content accordingly. I have also devised a way to build the slides directly from the module output text and am planning to run this as a separate script project but want to be sure this won't cause a problem with a second menu (something we encountered when treating the building of individual module resources as \"Project 2\" - ie I had to ultimately bring 2 projects together otherwise the menus didn't work). please check this code and suggest any improvements\n\n**Claude:**  **\ud83d\udea8 CRITICAL INTEGRATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED**\n\nYou're absolutely right to be concerned about the menu conflicts",
