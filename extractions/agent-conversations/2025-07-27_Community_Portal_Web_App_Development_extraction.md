- Details: Is that the SFTP credentials for elementor (valid for 24 hours then change after I access them???)

**Claude:**  **YES! EXACTLY!** 🎯

But wait - there's actually an **EASIER way** that doesn't involve those annoying 24-hour SFTP credentials!

---

## **🎯 BEST METHOD: Use WordPress Admin Login (Easier!)**

### **SiteGround Offers TWO Migration Methods:**

### **Method 1: WordPress Login (RECOMMENDED!)** ⭐
This is what I originally told you - it's MUCH easier!

**What SiteGround Needs:**
```
Migration Method: WordPress Admin Access
Website URL: yoursite. No FTP drama! ✅

---

### **Method 2: FTP/SFTP Credentials (Backup Option)**
Only use this if Method 1 doesn't work!

**If you MUST use FTP, here's how to get Elementor's SFTP:**

1. com (or an IP address)
SFTP Port: 22
Username: something_like_this
Password: [generated password valid 24 hours]
```

**Then give SiteGround:**
```
Control Panel URL/FTP Host: [the SFTP Host above]
Username: [SFTP username]
Password: [SFTP password]
Port: 22
```

---

## **⚠️ THE 24-HOUR PROBLEM:**

**YES, Elementor's SFTP passwords expire in 24 hours!** 😤

### **If Using SFTP Method:**

- Details: **They'll either:**
   - Guide you through getting Elementor credentials
   - OR offer to do a "WordPress Admin" method instead
   - OR work with you in real-time to complete migration

## **📸 WHERE TO FIND SFTP IN ELEMENTOR:**

It's usually in one of these places:

**Path 1:**
`Elementor Dashboard → Hosting → SFTP/SSH Access`

**Path 2:**
`Elementor Dashboard → Website Settings → Developer Tools → SFTP`

**Path 3:**
`Elementor Dashboard → Advanced → File Manager → SFTP Credentials`

**Look for words like:**
- SFTP
- SSH
- FTP Access
- Developer Access
- File Access
- Technical Details

---

## **💡 PRO TIP:**

If you're having trouble finding it:

**Contact Elementor Support:**
1. Send you the "Migration Complete" email

**This method is actually MORE reliable than SFTP!** 🎉

---

## **🚀 WHY THIS HAPPENED:**

Elementor's weird SFTP setup (port 32022) sometimes doesn't play nice with migration tools. This is actually a **good thing** because:
- ✅ WordPress login method is more reliable
- ✅ Gets all your data cleanly
- ✅ No more 24-hour expiring passwords
- ✅ Migration will complete faster now!
