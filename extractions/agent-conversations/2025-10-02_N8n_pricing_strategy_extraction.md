### Methodology

**Summary:** **Conversation Overview**

- Details: # N8n pricing strategy

**Summary:** **Conversation Overview**

The user is developing a sophisticated course building tool using n8n (a workflow automation platform) running locally via Docker Desktop
- Confidence: medium

**Thread 2:** Methodology: They have access to notebook LM a business on a business plan so that gives that gives the access to
- Details: They have access to notebook LM a business on a business plan so that gives that gives the access to readability of all of their Drive folders and files by using notebook LM to actually create what I refer to as the course recommendation that’s the framework for the whole course and so I stepped them through the prompt provide the prompt for them to use and they just have to implement that and if they go, they bring that Recommendation from notebook LM onto that form as text so that I don’t have any downstream issues with AI not being able to read a PDF for URL if that’s it’s too hard and what happens then is this course concept goes from being one idea into 10 to 12 separate standalone modules. **Comfort level check** - are you comfortable SSH-ing into a server and running terminal commands, or would you prefer a more point-and-click approach through AWS console?

**Here's what the migration will involve (high level):**
- Spin up an EC2 instance (or use existing)
- Install Docker on it
- Move your n8n installation there
- Connect it via Cloudflare tunnel so it's securely accessible
- Export your existing workflows and import them to the new instance

**Before you answer those questions though - CRITICAL question:**

Your current n8n workflows - are they actually working and producing decent output when your laptop is on? Or are they still being debugged/rebuilt? 

I need to know if we're migrating something that works (and just needs stability) or if we're also going to rebuild the workflows from scratch once we've moved to AWS

### Correction

**Thread 2:** Correction: **User:** I’m happy to learn as I go and that’s sort of my problem that I’ve actually jumped in with
- Details: **User:** I’m happy to learn as I go and that’s sort of my problem that I’ve actually jumped in with guidance from yourself and Manus without having an understanding and I’ve landed at a point where I’ve had to rebuild workflows in an 18 so many times with with the laptop having to turn off for Just finding the workflow is becoming ridiculously complicated and wanting to reset them to make them more logical they didn’t waste all the tokens on different AI tools. It was for the wave tool kit and it was just there was one little bug in it and it wouldn’t help it wouldn’t allow a saving mechanism to work for this tool or Web app but that’s the only thing so it’s sort of it’s in place, but I haven’t used it for anything yet my. **Your AWS/Cloudflare tunnel** - when you tried setting up the Wave toolkit, what exactly is in place now? Do you have an EC2 instance running, or was it all abandoned when the save bug appeared?

I want to give you a clear, step-by-step migration plan, but I need to understand what's actually working vs what's sitting dormant vs what's actively causing you problems
