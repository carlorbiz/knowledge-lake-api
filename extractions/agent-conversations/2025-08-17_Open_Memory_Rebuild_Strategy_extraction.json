Let's systematically check what Fred suggested and see what you've implemented. py\n```\n\n**Look for**: Do you have CORS middleware allowing `http://localhost:3000`?\n\n## **Quick Assessment Method**\n\nLet's check each file one by one:\n\n1. add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"http://localhost:3000\"],\n    allow_credentials=True,\n    allow_methods=[\"*\"],\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],\n)\n```\n\n## **Test Current Status**\n\nFirst, let's test if the basic API works:\n\n```powershell\nInvoke-RestMethod -Uri \"http://127",
