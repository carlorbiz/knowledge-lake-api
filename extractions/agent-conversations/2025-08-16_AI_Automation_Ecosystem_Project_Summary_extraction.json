Let's avoid the frustration by getting Colin and Google AI Studio to review the complete plan before we dive into implementation. Given your security-first approach with local hosting, are you interested in Google solutions that can run locally or hybrid setups?\n\nOnce I understand what specific Google offering you're exploring, I'll launch comprehensive research to analyse how it compares with n8n and Make",
