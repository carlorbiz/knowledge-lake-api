Statutory Obligations – clause 5

Fixed term contracts and the NES

• Training providers may allow employment of AGPT registrars over a 12-

month or even 24-month period, but the registrar must commence each 6-

month training semester under a separate fixed term contract aligned with 

the validity of their Medicare Provider Number (MPN)

• Fixed term contracts are treated differently under Fair Work Act 2009 and 

have specific requirements for the employer
