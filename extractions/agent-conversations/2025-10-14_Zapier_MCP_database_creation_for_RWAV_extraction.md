- Details: do you identify any issues? will the MCP permissions (Drive and Notion access etc) persist for the attached AI agents not just Fred?

**Claude:** This is a fascinating test of the piggybacked MCP concept! Let me analyse the theoretical possibilities and practical challenges:

## What's Theoretically Possible ✅

1. **Document review workflow**: The sequence you've outlined is logically sound

## Potential Issues I Can Identify 🚨

### 1. **MCP Permission Inheritance**
- **Critical Issue**: MCPs are typically user-specific and don't cascade permissions
- Fred might have access to YOUR Drive/Notion through his MCP
- But Manus, Penny, and Gemini would need their OWN authenticated MCPs to access your Drive
- They can't "borrow" Fred's permissions - each AI needs individual OAuth authentication

### Insight

**Thread 1:** Breakthrough in Zapier MCP database creation for RWAV
- Details: Claude documented this breakthrough experiment as a significant learning about AI ecosystem architecture, noting that native integrations prove more robust than MCP chains for complex coordination tasks. Manus has a bundle of permissions innately and through the connectors I've added at the GUI level (Add Docs, Sheets, Slides & other files from Google Drive; full Notion access)

**Claude:** Ah, excellent clarification! This changes everything
- Confidence: high

### Methodology

- Details: The database was intended to contain four main components: a strategic plan for 2026-2030, a methodology report including IMG sponsorship recommendations, a record of evidence with stakeholder meeting summaries and pulse survey data, and recommended next steps. However, this API-based ChatGPT access lacks the GUI-level integrations and permissions that would be available through direct ChatGPT interface usage, creating a fundamental limitation for multi-AI coordination scenarios

**User:** Claude, can you access the Zapier MCP and instruct Fred (ChatGPT) to create a new database in Notion "RWAV Strategic Plan Final" and add separate pages under this for the final, clean versions of the outputs generated under the ChatGPT Project in our UI "Carlorbiz-RWAV": a) strategic plan for 2026-2030, b) 2-page report on the process undertaken to extract the key themes and the methodologies behind the recommendations presented eg IMG sponsorship, c) record of evidence (compilation of individual meeting summaries for each stakeholder, Director, Board and Team interaction, plus a full report on the pulse survey with a separate table of qual responses individually listed and grouped by theme against location and role), and d) recommended next steps. can you please check your capabilities again now and let me know if you can perform all or any of the previous task I set you? Namely: access the Zapier MCP and instruct Fred (ChatGPT) to create a new database in Notion "RWAV Strategic Plan Final" and add separate pages under this for the final, clean versions of the outputs generated under the ChatGPT Project in our UI "Carlorbiz-RWAV": a) strategic plan for 2026-2030, b) 2-page report on the process undertaken to extract the key themes and the methodologies behind the recommendations presented eg IMG sponsorship, c) record of evidence (compilation of individual meeting summaries for each stakeholder, Director, Board and Team interaction, plus a full report on the pulse survey with a separate table of qual responses individually listed and grouped by theme against location and role), and d) recommended next steps
