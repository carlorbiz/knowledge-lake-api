### 🖍️ COLOUR PALETTE

| Colour Role | Suggestion | Meaning |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Base Neutral** | Charcoal or Slate Grey | Clarity, seriousness, steadiness |

| **Accent 2 (optional)** | Soft Indigo or Dusty Teal | Reflective depth without heaviness |
| **Success/Progress State** | Muted Emerald | Regrowth, trust, forward movement |

👉 **Avoid**: pastel pinks, harsh black-and-white contrast, neon or hyper-saturated tones

---

### 🅰️ FONT PAIRING

| Use | Font Style |
|-----|------------|
| **Headings** | Nunito SemiBold – approachable but structured |
| **Body Text** | Quicksand or Open Sans – soft, readable, friendly |
| **Buttons/Labels** | All caps, spaced slightly, grey-on-ochre or sage-on-sand |

---

|---------|-----------|
| **Icons** | Line icons only; consistent weight; no cartoon styling |

|---------|----------|
| **Homepage** | Calm dashboard with a visible progress bar (circle fill or arc) |
| **Modules Tab** | Card layout with hover/tap to reveal short preview & icon |
| **Journal Tab** | Minimal layout – two selectors only (Mood, Affirmation) |
| **Success Indicators** | Completion ticks, “You’ve unlocked insight #X”, or affirmations sliding into view—not gamified stars/trophies |

- Details: , affirmations, modules) and want the flexibility of spreadsheet tools
- You’re collaborating with a team or VA on content setup

### 👍 Pros:
- Easy to **duplicate, export, archive**, and restore old content versions  
- Lets you use **Google Sheets tools** (filters, formulas, cleanup) during prep  
- Great for content tables like `Affirmations`, `Modules`, `Resources`

### 👎 Cons:
- Requires **manual redefinition of column types** inside Glide after import  
- No user-specific columns unless manually recreated  
- **Sync lag** (sometimes up to a few minutes)

---

## 🧠 Recommended Hybrid Strategy for *Make the Most of Today*

| Table | Best Format | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| `Modules` | Glide Table | You’ve finalised content—best to build it cleanly with proper column types |
| `JournalLog` | Glide Table | Needs user-specific fields and mood logic—best handled natively |
| `Users` | Glide Table | Must use Glide’s user system and computed columns |
| `Affirmations` | Start in Google Sheets → then import | Easier to mass edit now and rotate module-based entries |
| `Resources` | Google Sheet | Static links + optional grouping—easy to update outside Glide |
| `Subscriptions` | Either | Depends if you’re integrating with Stripe via Make. ---

## ✅ WHERE YOU'RE AT RIGHT NOW

### 💡 Concept: *Make the Most of Today* – Emotional Labour Coaching App
- **Tone & vision**: Clear – *Grounded… now ready to soar*
- **Target user**: Professionals recovering from trauma, illness, or identity shift
- **Core structure**: 6 guided modules + affirmation-based journalling

---

### 📦 Assets & Components Completed

| Component | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **All 6 Module Scripts** | ✅ Complete | Reflection, teaching, affirmations, integration prompts, audio scripts |
| **Affirmations CSV** | ✅ Complete | Mapped to modules, designed for journal selector |
| **Wireframe mockup** | ✅ Done | Home screen concept for visual reference |
| **Glide Table Schema** | ✅ Complete | CSV of all columns, tables, types, and logic |
| **Visual Branding Brief** | ✅ Complete | Fonts, colours, layout tone – consistent and accessible |
| **Audio Scripts** | ✅ Complete | One per module, 45–60 seconds, ready for voiceover |

---

## 🚧 WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NEXT

### 🔧 Step 1: Choose Build Approach per Table

| Table | Build in Glide? | Or Start in Google Sheets? | Action |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| `Users` | ✅ YES | ❌ NO | Create in Glide – essential for logins and user-specific data |
| `Modules` | ✅ YES | Optional | Import CSV into Glide Table if preferred |
| `Affirmations` | ✅ Glide or Sheet | ✅ Google Sheet to start | Use your existing CSV to build selector with filtering |
| `JournalLog` | ✅ YES | ❌ NO | Needs user-specific data – mood + affirmation only |
| `Resources` | Optional | ✅ YES | Use Google Sheet for easy updates/downloads |
| `Subscriptions` | ✅ YES | Or connect via Stripe / Make. ---

### 2️⃣ **Prevent Duplicate Resources**  
(So you don’t get 10 entries for Beyond Blue)

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| 🧪 Use `Website` as a Unique Identifier | Create a **Relation** and **If Then Else** to flag if a resource already exists |
| ⚠️ Glide visibility logic | Show a warning if the submitted URL already exists in the table |
| 📝 Add status column | `Duplicate?`, `Approved`, `SubmittedBy`, `DateAdded`—so you can moderate with ease

---

### 3️⃣ **Add “Thumbs Up / Down” Interactivity**  
(Great for community trust + surfacing valuable resources)

| Setup | What to do |
|-------|------------|
| Add 2 user-specific number columns: `ThumbsUp` / `ThumbsDown` |
| Create buttons with increment actions + emoji/icons |
| Optional: Display % helpful score (👍 / total votes) |

---

### 4️⃣ **User Feedback Trigger**  
(So they can suggest new categories or resources you hadn’t thought of)

| Method | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|
| 📥 “Don’t see your experience listed?” button |
| Opens: a **Contact Carla screen**, or a **Glide form** |
| Fields: Email (prefilled), Suggested Category, Suggested Resource, Why it matters |
| Optionally send: Make

**Assistant:** Of course, Carla — you’ve been *absolutely flying* through this project, and it’s completely fair to pause, zoom out, and check the map. **Thumbs Up / Down Voting UI**

- Details: ---

### 💡 Why?
| Feature | Glide Table | Google Sheet |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **User submissions (live updates)** | ✅ Instant display | ❌ Delays / sync issues |
| **Thumbs up/down voting** | ✅ Works natively | ⚠️ Not supported reliably |
| **Moderation with visibility toggles** | ✅ Easy (e. **Paste** (`Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V`) — Glide will automatically create matching columns and rows

---

### 🛠 STEP 4: Format Your Columns

Glide will auto-detect, but it’s good to review:

| Column | Set As |
|--------|--------|
| `Title` | Text |
| `Type` | Choice (or Text if fixed) |
| `Description` | Text |
| `Website` | URL |
| `Country` | Text |
| `LinkedModule` | Relation (to `Modules`) |
| `EmotionalCategory` | Choice (linked to `Categories`) |
| `UserSubmitted` | Yes/No |
| `Approved` | Yes/No |
| `ThumbsUp` / `ThumbsDown` | User-specific Number (see note below) |

> 🧠 **Note:** Glide doesn't allow pasting directly into *user-specific* columns—so just create these manually after pasting:
- Click “+ Add Column” → choose “User-specific column” → select “Number”
- Do this for `ThumbsUp` and `ThumbsDown`

---

### ✅ STEP 5: Add Any Missing Relations

To connect your `Resources` table to:
- `Modules` → create a **Relation** on `LinkedModule`
- `Categories` → create a **Choice component** on `EmotionalCategory` using the `Categories` table

---

### 🌟 BONUS: Visibility Logic

To show only reviewed content to users:
- Add filter to your Resource List: `Approved is True`
- Or display a badge/label like “Pending Approval” for user-submitted entries
