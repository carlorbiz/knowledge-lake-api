## Pass 3: Per-Thread Learnings

**Extracted 3 learnings:**

### Correction

**Thread 1:** Correction: She was experiencing critical issues where no audio files were being generated, acronyms were being 
- Details: She was experiencing critical issues where no audio files were being generated, acronyms were being incorrectly swapped (ACRRM becoming RACGP), letters were being dropped from initialisms (AGPT becoming AGP), and voiceover scripts were the wrong length (2-3 minutes instead of the required 60-90 seconds). She also corrected specific phonetic spellings, particularly ensuring ACRRM becomes "Ackr'm" not "Ackrim" and that "data" is pronounced as "dahta" in Australian English
- Confidence: medium

**Thread 2:** Correction: Currently this has been thrown to the TTS to decipher when translating that script into audio (which
- Details: Currently this has been thrown to the TTS to decipher when translating that script into audio (which is probably where it is coming undone)

**Claude:** RIGHT! I can see EXACTLY what's broken! 🚨

**THE PROBLEM:**

1. ❌ **Phonetic replacements applied in WRONG place** - they're being applied to the voiceover script just before TTS, which:
   - Changes the script but not the slide content
   - Can cause regex issues that break the script
   - The TTS gets confused with mixed instructions
3. )
- TTS receives clean, phonetically-spelled text without confusion

Let me create the FIXED version starting from Complete:

**User:** claude don't lose my AU accent prompt

**Claude:** OH CRAP - you're absolutely right! 🚨 Let me add back the Australian accent instructions explicitly into the TTS call!

**User:** NOOO I created an Australian accent that is not the embarrassing ocker accent the TTS will default to - see previous script for instructions about blending US/UK and western european accents
- Confidence: medium

### Methodology

**Thread 2:** Methodology: DELIVERY SPECIFICATIONS: - Conversational inflection as if speaking to valued colleague - Profession
- Details: DELIVERY SPECIFICATIONS: - Conversational inflection as if speaking to valued colleague - Professional authority with approachable warmth - Clear articulation for adult learning - Pace: 160-180 words per minute - Strategic pauses for emphasis - Australian pronunciation: broad 'a' sounds (dance, castle), natural rhythm CRITICAL EXCLUSIONS: - NO Australian slang (G'day, mate, fair dinkum) - NO exaggerated vowel sounds or stereotypes - NO informal cultural references - Maintain sophisticated professional standards VOICE SELECTION: Female: Kore (authoritative), Aoede (warm), Erinome (professional), Gacrux (analytical) Male: Charon (confident), Orus (approachable), Enceladus (experienced), Achird (thoughtful) Read this content as if listener is valued professional team member: [CONTENT TO BE READ]

**Claude:** PERFECT! Now I'll restore YOUR sophisticated Australian voice instructions! 🇦🇺

**User:** pretty sure you've truncated this claude - I have 600 fewer lines here

**Claude:** OH CRAP! You're absolutely right! I truncated all those functions with ". \n\n${script}`;
```

**Option C: KEEP CURRENT (full instructions)**
```javascript
const text = `${voicePrompt}\n\n${australianAccentPrompt}\n\n${script}`;
```

**Which approach do you want?** My instinct says **Option A** - let the phonetic spellings do ALL the work, and let the voice selection (Charon, Aoede, etc
