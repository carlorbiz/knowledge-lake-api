      "evidence": "txt file** for unlimited content capture via attachment\n\n## Key Points for Your Testing:\n\n**Email Format Compliance:**\n- Uses your exact section headers for proper database mapping\n- Keeps pre-delimiter content concise (under 1200 characters)\n- Classifies as \"AAE Development\" and \"High Impact\" (breakthrough solution)\n\n**Extended Synthesis Strategy:**  \n- Comprehensive technical analysis without character limits\n- Plain text format for optimal n8n processing\n- Covers implementation details, business implications, and scaling opportunities\n\n## Next Steps:\n1",
