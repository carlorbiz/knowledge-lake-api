**User:** Fred, Claude is bugging out on me mid stream (length of chat dramas) and I fear I will never get this AI Automated Masterpiece set up! Can you pick this up so we can get that central memory hub up and running asap?
Claude, I'm implementing an MCP-powered AI Content Ecosystem to eliminate conversation fragmentation. Please guide me through any issues with the terminal commands above. Let me walk you through potential issues you might encounter with those terminal commands and how to troubleshoot them:
Potential Issues & Solutions
Step 2: pip install -r requirements

**Thread 4:** Correction: Let's diagnose and fix this issue

If schema rejects `app_id` in the body, no problem—we go with Option A and wire Notion. Risk Mitigation for Local-First
- Because your memory and automation run locally, Notion holds the **master record** of:
  - All platform configurations
  - Update history
  - Known bugs/fixes  
- If the local server goes down, your processes and content state are still accessible in Notion, so you can resume or redeploy without losing your place. **User:** {'content_type': 'image_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'file-service://file-E1a1DbKA4fTrxJ5GVsHa6k', 'size_bytes': 100696, 'width': 834, 'height': 1357, 'fovea': None, 'metadata': {'dalle': None, 'gizmo': None, 'generation': None, 'container_pixel_height': None, 'container_pixel_width': None, 'emu_omit_glimpse_image': None, 'emu_patches_override': None, 'lpe_keep_patch_ijhw': None, 'sanitized': True, 'asset_pointer_link': None, 'watermarked_asset_pointer': None}}
I just noticed this error/warning in my Github mem0 repository - could this be causing the problem? 

**Assistant:** Great catch — and no, that GitHub warning is **not** what’s causing the API/memory behavior you’re seeing
- Confidence: medium

**Thread 11:** Correction: ---

Do you want me to stay with you while you restart and run this POST/GET cycle so we can confirm
- Details: ---

Do you want me to stay with you while you restart and run this POST/GET cycle so we can confirm you’re 100% past the “Memory client is not available” issue?

**User:** Sorry Fred - where is this again?

**Assistant:** No problem — here’s exactly where and how to find it. SQLite often has locking issues on synced drives. **User:** {'content_type': 'image_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'file-service://file-AbioHqbmPED6shNLHmBKU4', 'size_bytes': 156300, 'width': 2048, 'height': 702, 'fovea': None, 'metadata': {'dalle': None, 'gizmo': None, 'generation': None, 'container_pixel_height': None, 'container_pixel_width': None, 'emu_omit_glimpse_image': None, 'emu_patches_override': None, 'lpe_keep_patch_ijhw': None, 'sanitized': True, 'asset_pointer_link': None, 'watermarked_asset_pointer': None}}
Is there any chance the lack of a Container ID for openmemory in Docker is causing problems?

**Assistant:** Short answer: **that “openmemory” row with no Container ID isn’t your problem

- Details: js (version 16+ recommended)
npm install failures: Try npm install --legacy-peer-deps if you get dependency conflicts
Port 3000 occupied: The dev server will automatically suggest an alternative port

Monitoring Success
You'll know it's working when:

API terminal shows "Server running on http://localhost:8000" (or similar)
UI terminal shows "Local: http://localhost:3000"
Browser dashboard loads without errors

Troubleshooting Strategy
If you hit any snags:

Copy the exact error message - I can provide specific solutions
Check the terminal output - often contains helpful hints
