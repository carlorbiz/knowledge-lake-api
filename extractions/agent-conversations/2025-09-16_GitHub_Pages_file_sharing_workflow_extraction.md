## Quick Method: Search and Replace

You can also use Find/Replace in your text editor:
1. **User:** I only want to remove the button as an option until I figure out the AWS database issue preventing save to cloud

- Details: The cleanest approach is to remove all cloud functionality completely and focus on reliable local storage with clear export/import messaging. ## Debugging Strategy

The JavaScript functions you've shown me look fine, so let's find where the script is actually breaking:

## 1. Common locations where this happens:**
- After a function definition (missing closing brace)
- In event handlers
- In conditional statements outside functions

## Quick Search Method

Search your HTML file for:
- `return`
- Look for any `return` that's NOT inside a function

## Temporary Fix Test

Comment out the problematic return statement:
```javascript
// return false;
```

Then refresh and test if the Add buttons work

### Correction

**Thread 2:** Correction: **User:** Now the Add button isn't working

**Claude:** Let's troubleshoot the Add button issue
- Details: **User:** Now the Add button isn't working

**Claude:** Let's troubleshoot the Add button issue. Which step shows an error or issue? The console errors will give us the exact line that's causing the problem. ## The Problem

The errors show:
- `addResearchQuestion is not defined` (line 427)
- `addStakeholderItem is not defined` (line 454)

This usually happens when there's a JavaScript syntax error that breaks the entire script, preventing function definitions from loading
