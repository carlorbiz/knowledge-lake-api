- Details: They identified a critical issue where previous content generated for Module 6 was incorrectly about workforce succession planning instead of the actual topic "Managing Critical Incidents and Near Misses. Claude compiled an extensive technical document outlining critical issues including topic accuracy problems, assessment complexity and format issues, Australian context requirements, content structure improvements, quality control checklists, and specific prompt engineering improvements. **User:** claude, please prepare a summary of all the fixes we made outside the apps script functions to get the modules fully built out in Absorb LMS - I need to provide this to Claude Code so the apps script prompts can be updated and bake in the improvements we made

## Critical Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1
- Confidence: medium

### Methodology

**Thread 1:** Methodology: **Assessment Complexity & Format Issues**
**Issue:** Generated assessments were too complex and not 
- Details: **Assessment Complexity & Format Issues**
**Issue:** Generated assessments were too complex and not compatible with Absorb LMS/iSpring capabilities

**Original Problems:**
- Assessments generated as complex JSON structures
- Role-play scenarios were too elaborate for LMS implementation
- Audio scripts were disconnected from assessment content
- MCQ formats didn't match iSpring Suite Max capabilities
- Too many assessment variations (10 MCQs + 3 role-plays + audio) made implementation difficult

**Fix Required:**
The Apps Script should generate exactly **5 simplified assessment types** per module:

### Required Assessment Format (Per Module):

#### **Assessment Type 1: Foundational Knowledge - Multiple Choice (Checkbox Style)**
```
**Question:** [Clear question testing basic knowledge]

- ☐ [Incorrect option]
- ☑ [Correct option]
- ☐ [Incorrect option]
- ☐ [Incorrect option]

**Rationale:** [Brief explanation of correct answer]
```

#### **Assessment Type 2: Most Important Factor (Colored Box Options)**
```
**Scenario:** [2-3 sentence realistic GP training practice scenario]

**Question:** What is the MOST important factor/action/consideration?

**OPTION A:** [Description] (Color: Teal/Blue)
**OPTION B:** [Description] (Color: Blue - this is usually correct)
**OPTION C:** [Description] (Color: Orange)
**OPTION D:** [Description] (Color: Yellow)
**OPTION E:** [Description] (Color: Grey)

**Correct Answer: Option B** - [Brief justification]
```

#### **Assessment Type 3: Correct Sequence (Ordering/Drag-Drop)**
```
**Question:** Place the following [process/steps] in the correct order:

**Step 1:** [First action]
**Step 2:** [Second action]
**Step 3:** [Third action]
**Step 4:** [Fourth action]
**Step 5:** [Fifth action]

[These should be presented in random order to learner, they drag into correct sequence]
```

#### **Assessment Type 4: Match Items (Drag and Drop Matching)**
```
**Instructions:** Match each [concept/strategy/element] to its [purpose/description/implementation]:

**[ITEM/CONCEPT] → [TARGET/DESCRIPTION]**

- **[Item 1]** → DROP TARGET: [Matching description 1]
- **[Item 2]** → DROP TARGET: [Matching description 2]
- **[Item 3]** → DROP TARGET: [Matching description 3]
- **[Item 4]** → DROP TARGET: [Matching description 4]

[Learner drags items to correct drop targets]
```

#### **Assessment Type 5: Scenario-Based Multiple Choice (with Image Context)**
```
**Scenario:** [3-4 sentence detailed realistic scenario from Australian GP training context]

**Question:** [Specific question about scenario requiring application of knowledge]

- ○ [Clearly incorrect option]
- ○ [Plausible but incorrect option]
- ● [Correct option with specific action/approach]
- ○ [Another incorrect option]

**Correct Answer:** [Correct option repeated] 
**Rationale:** [2-3 sentence explanation]
```
