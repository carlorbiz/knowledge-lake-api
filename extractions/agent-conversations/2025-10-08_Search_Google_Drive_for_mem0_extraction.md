## Pass 3: Per-Thread Learnings

**Extracted 2 learnings:**

### Correction

**Thread 1:** Correction: **Issue around 5 parallel queries at a time** to maximize recall
- Details: **Issue around 5 parallel queries at a time** to maximize recall. Example: {queries = ["DevOpsSubs"]}
Bad: {queries = [""DevOpsSubs""]}

**Examples:**
Example 1: Question: What's the budget for DevSubs FY25?
Good:
{queries = ["DevSubs", "DevSubs OR FY25", "DevSubs AND FY25", "DevSubs FY25", "DevSubs FY25 budget"]}
Bad: (too many ORs + long text)
{queries = ["DevSubs OR FY25 OR finance OR budget increase for DevSubs FY25"]}
Example 2: Question: How does respondToWater work?
Good:
{queries = ["respondToWater", "respondToWater()", "respond To Water", "respondToWater code"]}
Bad: (too many ORs + long text)
{queries = ["respondToWater OR respondToWater() OR respond To Water enchanted greenhouse"]}

### Important on effort level:
Stick to clear, keyword-focused queries, issue around five searches in the "queries" field per attempt
Open documents to confirm relevance - Please open multiple documents at once and read them, making sure to be thorough before declaring cannot find. **Issue around 5 parallel queries at a time** to maximize recall

### Methodology

**Thread 3:** Methodology: json`, propsJson);
return { data: { dir } };

*(If you prefer staying “node-native” in n8n, skip 
- Details: json`, propsJson);
return { data: { dir } };
```
*(If you prefer staying “node-native” in n8n, skip direct `fs` in Function and instead pass buffers to three **Write Binary File** nodes—both approaches work since you mounted the volume. ```json
