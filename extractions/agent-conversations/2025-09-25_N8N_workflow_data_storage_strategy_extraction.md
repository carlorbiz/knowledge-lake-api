- Details: She identified authentication stability issues with Google Drive API that were blocking automation workflows and successfully pivoted to Google Docs API for more reliable document creation and population. The technical implementation involved resolving complex data flow issues including proper node referencing syntax in n8n, handling nested JSON structures from Perplexity responses, managing OAuth2 authentication across multiple Google services, and developing strategies for multi-agent evidence sharing through Notion URL storage. Here's the corrected flow:

**Claude:**  **ISSUE BRIEF FOR MANU: Google Docs Integration Problem in n8n**

**Context:**
Building an automated workflow where Claude AI generates long-form course content (5,000+ characters) that needs to be stored as Google Docs and linked back to Notion. **Current Setup:**
- n8n sub-workflow called "Text-to-GoogleDoc-Linker"
- Trigger: "When executed by another workflow"
- Input: JSON with `title`, `content`, `sourceWorkflow`
- Goal: Create Google Doc with content, return shareable URL

**Problems Encountered:**

1. **Google Drive approach**: Also failed with authentication/parameter issues

**What We Need:**

1. What does the output of your trigger node show?

**User:** **Output**

[
{
"title": null,
"content": null,
"sourceWorkflow": null
}
]

**Claude:**  There's the problem! Your trigger node is outputting `null` values instead of the JSON example data you defined

**Thread 8:** Correction: Which approach do you prefer - debug the sub-workflow trigger or add the Google Doc creation directl
- Details: Which approach do you prefer - debug the sub-workflow trigger or add the Google Doc creation directly to your main workflow?

**User:** name is still not carrying from the Title variable

**Claude:**  I can see the issue - the `{{ $json. document"  
}
```

If the hardcoded version creates a properly named Google Doc, then we know the issue is purely with the expression syntax, not the API call itself. **Try this debugging approach:**

**Change to Query Parameters instead of JSON body:**
- **Body Content Type**: None
- **Query Parameters**:
  - **Name**: `name`
  - **Value**: `{{ $('Set Fields')

- Details: Given the time we're spending on expression syntax issues, let's go back to your main workflow and add the Google Doc creation directly there. Which approach do you prefer - debug this further or add Google Doc creation directly to your main workflow?

**User:** can I use n8n Binary file as the para type under Form-Data?

**Claude:**  No, n8n Binary file parameter type won't work for this use case. Try the hardcoded form-data approach - if that works, we know the issue is purely with the dynamic data referencing, not the API call itself
- Confidence: medium

**Thread 11:** Correction: We can optimize architecture later when you're not fighting expression evaluation bugs
- Details: We can optimize architecture later when you're not fighting expression evaluation bugs. The fundamental issue is likely the same regardless of where we put the HTTP request - if the expression evaluation or API call isn't working in the sub-workflow, it probably won't work in the main workflow either. **The core problem appears to be one of these:**

**Thread 12:** Correction: The issue is likely elsewhere - either in the n8n credential configuration or the API request itself
- Details: The issue is likely elsewhere - either in the n8n credential configuration or the API request itself. **Your configuration looks right:**
- Auth URLs are correct
- Client ID is there
- Account is connected ✅

**But I notice one potential issue - the Scope field:**

I can see there's a "Scope" field but I can't see what's in it from your screenshot. This points to a deeper issue with how n8n is sending the HTTP request body
- Confidence: medium

**Thread 13:** Correction: site was crucial - it showed the real issue was Google API headers, not n8n configuration
- Details: site was crucial - it showed the real issue was Google API headers, not n8n configuration. **If the document is empty, the issue is likely:**

1. **Content field is empty** - Check that your "Edit Fields" node actually has content in the output

**Debug the content reference:**

Add a simple test by temporarily hardcoding content in the second HTTP Request:

```json
{
  "requests": [
    {
      "insertText": {
        "location": {
          "index": 1
        },
        "text": "This is test content to verify the insertion works
- Confidence: medium

**Thread 14:** Correction: **The issue is likely:**
The Code node is trying to reference `$('HTTP Request')
- Details: **The issue is likely:**
The Code node is trying to reference `$('HTTP Request'). **A connection issue** where the Code node can't see the first HTTP Request node
3. **Node naming problem** - the node isn't called exactly "HTTP Request"

**Fix this by:**

**Option 1: Use explicit node references**
Rename your first HTTP Request node to something unique like "Create Doc" and update the Code node:

```javascript
return {
  json: {
    docUrl: `https://docs

"Full content available in linked Google Doc"
}
]

**
- Details: com/document/d/undefined/edit",
"docSummary": 
"Full content available in linked Google Doc"
}
]

**Claude:**  The issue is clear now - the Code node can't access the `id` field from the HTTP Request1 input data you showed me, even though it's clearly there in the input structure. **Let's debug this step by step. Update your Code node to:**

```javascript
// Debug to see exactly what's available

**Summary:** **Conversation Overview**

The user, Carla, is developing a sophisticated multi-agent AI automation ecosystem for her healthcare education business, specifically focusing on creating evidence-based professional development courses for Australian healthcare professionals through GPSA/HPSA. Carla demonstrated deep technical knowledge of workflow automation and emphasized the critical importance of maintaining sophisticated prompt frameworks and evidence-based credibility rather than accepting simplified approaches. The conversation revealed her systematic approach to building scalable automation that preserves professional standards, with particular attention to proper citation formats, regulatory compliance, and adult learner sophistication levels required for healthcare education markets

**Claude:**  Absolutely! That's a much more efficient approach. **Method**: POST

```

**Max Tokens**: 1000-2000

This will be much simpler than the HTTP Request approach - n8n handles all the API formatting, headers, and authentication automatically

**Alternative simpler approach:**
If you don't want to add Google Docs integration right now, you could:

1. **Add a note** that the full content is available via API call

The Google Doc approach is definitely better for your long-term workflow since Claude's course recommendations will often exceed Notion's text limits

Which approach would you like to try first - Google Drive node or the two-step Google Docs approach?

**User:** Google drive didn't work and now this is problematic

**Claude:**  I can see the issue - the "Update a document" operation is also failing because it needs a specific document ID, but we haven't created a document yet

**Claude:**  You're absolutely right! We started with the multipart
- Details: Can we try changing that first?

**Claude:**  You're absolutely right! We started with the multipart approach from Manu's guide, but your n8n doesn't support multipart form data. Since you don't have the multipart option, let's try the simpler approach first. The multipart approach was meant to do everything in one step (create doc + add content), but since your n8n interface doesn't support it, we'll use the two-step method: create empty doc first, then add content in a second HTTP request

- Details: Which approach do you prefer - debug this further or add Google Doc creation directly to your main workflow?

**User:** can I use n8n Binary file as the para type under Form-Data?

**Claude:**  No, n8n Binary file parameter type won't work for this use case. If the form-data approach with hardcoded values creates a properly named Google Doc, then we can work on getting the dynamic title to pass through correctly. Try the hardcoded form-data approach - if that works, we know the issue is purely with the dynamic data referencing, not the API call itself

**If that doesn't work, try a completely different approach:**

Position the Code node to run from the first HTTP Request instead of the second:

Edit Fields → HTTP Request → Code (format URL) → HTTP Request1 → Final output

This ensures the Code node has direct access to the document creation response. Let me suggest a simpler approach. com/document/d/${docId}/edit`,
    docId: docId,
    docSummary: "Full content available in linked Google Doc"
  }
}];
```

**If that doesn't work, try this debugging approach:**

```javascript
// Debug what data is available
console

- Details: **The problem is data flow - the Code node needs data from BOTH HTTP requests:**
- Document ID from HTTP Request (first one)
- Confirmation from HTTP Request1 (second one)

**Try this approach - modify your Code node to explicitly reference the first HTTP Request:**

```javascript
// Try to get the document ID from the first HTTP Request node
const docId = $('HTTP Request'). **Let's solve this with a simpler approach:**

**Add a Set node** right after the first HTTP Request (before HTTP Request1) to capture the document ID:

- Details: **This changes the research foundation access strategy:**

**Current Flow:**
- Perplexity Research → Research Foundation Google Doc → **Research Doc URL stored in Notion**
- Claude Course Generation → Course Recommendation → **Text stored in Agent 1 Output property**

**Multi-agent access pattern:**

**For Agent 1:** 
- Accesses research foundation via research doc URL
- Generates course recommendation 
- Stores recommendation as **text** in Notion

**For Agents 2 & 3:**
- **Fetch research foundation** via research doc URL stored in Notion database
- **Access course recommendation** as text from Agent 1 Output property
- Cross-reference both for evidence-based content generation

**Database structure:**
- **Research Foundation URL**: Link to comprehensive research Google Doc
- **Agent 1 Output**: Text field containing course recommendation
- **Agent 2 Output**: Text field for module content
- **Agent 3 Output**: Text field for voice/assessment content

**Implementation for subsequent agents:**
```javascript
// In Agent 2/3 nodes
const researchDocUrl = $('Get database page'). agent_1_output;

// Fetch research foundation + use course recommendation text
// Generate evidence-based content referencing both
```

This maintains your evidence-based approach while working with your existing Notion structure where agent outputs are stored as text properties rather than document URLs
