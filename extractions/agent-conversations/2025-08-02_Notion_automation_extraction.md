## 🎯 Your Two Paths

### ✅ Option 1: Use UUIDs (like `Areas`)
✔️ Consistent  
✔️ Works for auto-mapping  
❌ Requires manual ID matching if the project doesn’t exist yet  
❌ Can’t create new projects directly from the sheet

### ✅ Option 2: Use Text Input → Staged in a `Comment` Field (Your Idea)
✔️ Easy to enter  
✔️ Keeps your spreadsheet light and human  
✔️ Gives you flexibility to review and link new projects yourself  
✅ **This is the safest and smartest approach right now**

## 💥 The Problem:

> **[404] Could not find database with ID**

This happens because Make. I believe there should be an id on those individual pages I suppose from the areas database, could you step me through finding those and applying those for use in the google sheets to resolve this huge issue because it's one little flaw that's left. I have resolved the UUID issue and the issue was we shouldn't have included ID colon dah dah dah
