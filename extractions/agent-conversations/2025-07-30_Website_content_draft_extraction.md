case note review or, you know, every day, you know, pick up two records and have a look at 

them and then have a chat about them” for regular two-way discussion”

(15_SH_notIMG_Met). A planned approach to learning was recommended: “we should do … some very early 

assessments of capacity, knowledge and identify needs and then target some focus 

program at addressing the needs specific to the individual IMG” (15_SH_notIMG_Met). IMGs need confidence about the safety of the exit strategy: “If they find themselves, there 

is no exit

- Details: Expand IMGs’ access 

to fully funded, 

high-quality GP 

training programs in 

rural communities, 

where IMGs care for 

Australians with greater 

healthcare needs and 

often work in increased 

professional isolation

It is a matter of equity to provide high-quality low-cost GP training to IMGs who are filling 

critical roles in primary healthcare in rural communities with the highest needs: “we 

design programs just for them because they have problems, and then the program doesn’t 

address their problems and it’s just very scanty, very superficial… my feedback from IMGs 

is that why is it happening in that pathway and not happening to me? Why is it always, you 

know, good on one side, very well-funded program, very well looking after all the needs of 

registrars?. The issues around personal costs that IMGs encounter has already been discussed but 

need to be understood as cumulative across the IMG-specific assessments, for moving 

communities and then paying out-of-pocket for the rural GP training pathways they 

may be eligible for. I don’t want to put up 

a fight or make any problems
