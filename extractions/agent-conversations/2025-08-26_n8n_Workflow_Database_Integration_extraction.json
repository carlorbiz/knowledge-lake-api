The Code node is creating structured data, but you're still getting the same content in multiple fields because the parsing logic isn't actually extracting different parts - it's just using the same `fullText` variable for everything. The \"Jan-Research-Monitor\" would have been a different approach - one that monitors for existing Jan pages and converts them. **Webhook:** Set up Jan to trigger this workflow directly (if possible)\n\nWhich approach do you want to take to get Jan's actual research content into this working workflow?\n\n**User:** OK, but we need to prevent duplication - can we add a node to back up to Google Drive (ie add the same Jan entry to the MASTER_TASKS Google Sheet (I'll mirror the headers so the fields align with the Automation & Maintenance Schedule Notion DB) then another node to delete the individual page Jan created under Carla's HQ?\n\n**Claude:**  Absolutely! That's excellent thinking - prevent duplication by backing up to Google Sheets and cleaning up the standalone pages",
