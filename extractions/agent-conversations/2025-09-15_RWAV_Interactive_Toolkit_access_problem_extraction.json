The toolkit was designed to help users work through strategic planning frameworks, but faced a critical issue where users at RWAV lost their data when the IT department cleared browser caches daily. The user had previously moved the toolkit from standalone HTML to GitHub Pages and embedded it in Google Sites, but this didn't resolve the underlying localStorage data persistence problem",
