Is that how you were planning it?\n\n**Claude:**  **Perfect approach!** Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking - a real-time, adaptive interview where I respond to your answers with the next logical question. **Here's how we'll do it:**\n- I'll have all the key content points mapped out for each module\n- I'll start with one focused question \n- Based on how you answer, I'll craft the next question to either:\n  - Dig deeper into what you just said\n  - Gently guide you toward a key point you haven't hit yet\n  - Let you explore a tangent if it's valuable, then steer back\n  - Build on your personality and stories\n\n**The beauty of this approach:**\n- Your personality comes through naturally\n- We can catch missed points as we go\n- I can adapt to your energy and flow\n- You only focus on one question at a time\n- We create authentic, conversational content\n\n**And yes, I can help edit afterward** - I'll remember what key points we covered and what might need trimming or expanding",
