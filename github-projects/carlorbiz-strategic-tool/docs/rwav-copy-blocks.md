## SECTION 1: HERO / LANDING

### Main Headline
**Preparing a Bold Agenda for Rural Health Workforce Transformation**

### Subheadline
From recruitment agency to systems coordinator: RWAV's evidence-based pathway to becoming rural Victoria's trusted coordination leader.

### Introduction Paragraph
This strategic plan presents RWAV's transformation from government-dependent service deliverer to independent rural systems coordinator and coalition leader. Based on comprehensive stakeholder consultation—incorporating 19 sector-wide interviews and 120 survey responses—this transformation addresses the fundamental coordination crisis identified across rural Victoria.

### Key Statistics Callout
> **91%** see poor coordination as significant barrier  
> **74%** trust Rural Workforce Agencies  
> **66%** believe coordination could solve majority of problems  
> **92%** see health partnerships as positive impact

---

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (CURRENT STATE)

### Section Heading
**The Coordination Crisis**

### Problem Statement
Rural Victoria faces a fundamental systems failure. Despite significant investment in individual health services and programs, the lack of coordination between organisations creates inefficiencies, gaps, and missed opportunities that undermine rural health outcomes.

### Current State Description
RWAV currently operates as a government-funded workforce placement service, competing with other agencies for limited recruitment success. This model:

- Focuses on individual placements rather than systemic solutions
- Creates dependency on government funding cycles
- Limits strategic influence and cross-sector collaboration
- Underutilises RWAV's unique neutral position and established relationships

### Stakeholder Voice Callout
> "Health professionals need peers… Priority should be in supporting the building of one workforce that works across the various services in rural areas."  
> — Stakeholder Consultation

> "Stop stealing from each other and share resources."  
> — Regional Health Service Leader

---

## SECTION 3: THE SOLUTION (FUTURE VISION)

### Section Heading
**Rural Victoria's Trusted Systems Coordinator**

### Vision Statement
The transformation positions RWAV as rural Victoria's trusted systems coordinator, using data intelligence and coalition leadership—leveraging the trust the community and stakeholders already have—to drive retention, workforce planning, and health system reform. This addresses the coordination crisis while establishing sustainable revenue streams aligned with stakeholder needs.

### Strategic Positioning
RWAV stands at a pivotal moment. Extensive stakeholder consultation has validated a bold transformation from government-dependent workforce recruiter to independent systems coordinator and coalition leader. This shift positions RWAV as the central intelligence hub for rural health workforce coordination across Victoria.

### Transformation Benefits
- **For communities**: Voice in workforce planning, coordinated service delivery
- **For health services**: Reduced competition, shared resources, better recruitment outcomes
- **For government**: Evidence-based policy advice, coordination efficiency, improved outcomes
- **For RWAV**: Financial sustainability, strategic influence, mission alignment
