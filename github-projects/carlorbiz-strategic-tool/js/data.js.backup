  EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY: {
    currentState: "RWAV currently operates as a government-funded workforce placement service, competing with other agencies for limited recruitment success. This model focuses on individual placements rather than systemic solutions, creates dependency on government funding cycles, limits strategic influence and cross-sector collaboration, and underutilises RWAV's unique neutral position and established relationships.",
    
    futureVision: "The transformation positions RWAV as rural Victoria's trusted systems coordinator, using data intelligence and coalition leadership - leveraging the trust the community and stakeholders already have in other organisations - to drive retention, workforce planning, and health system reform. This addresses the coordination crisis while establishing sustainable revenue streams aligned with stakeholder needs.",
    
    evidenceSummary: "With 91% identifying poor coordination as a barrier, 66% believing coordination could solve the majority of problems, and 74% trusting RWAV, the mandate for transformation is unambiguous. The question is not whether RWAV should transform, but how quickly and effectively it can capture this coordination leadership opportunity.",
