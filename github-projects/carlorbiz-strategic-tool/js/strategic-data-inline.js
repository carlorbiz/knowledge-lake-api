    "currentState": "RWAV currently operates as a government-funded workforce placement service, competing with other agencies for limited recruitment success. This model focuses on individual placements rather than systemic solutions, creates dependency on government funding cycles, limits strategic influence and cross-sector collaboration, and underutilises RWAV's unique neutral position and established relationships.",

This addresses the coordination crisis while establishing sustainable revenue streams aligned with stakeholder needs.",
